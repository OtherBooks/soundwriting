    <title>Authoring and Styling Guide for <pubttile>Sound Writing</pubttile></title>
    <introduction>
        <p>This <q>chapter</q> of <pubtitle>Sound Writing</pubtitle> is meant to help future authors, editors, and <q>publishers</q> of the handbook make content additions and updates in a consistent way. Unlike text editing programs like Microsoft Word or Pages, <pretext/> is a <term>markup langugae</term>, which means that portions of text can be demarkated as <em>being a specific kind of text</em>, and formatting for how that text should be displayed can be determined for the <em>whole document</em> based on what the text is, strucuturally, rather than on how an author wants a particualr title to look in a specific instance. This approach to writing is perhaps unfamiliar to you (and probably feels limiting) if you normally write with programs like Word or Pages that let you individually control font, font size, indentation, stylistic elements, <etc/> on a case<ndash/>by<ndash/>case basis; however, the advantage of using a markup language is that it is easy to make document<ndash/>wide stylistic modifications quickly and consistently. To take advantage of these benifits, you, the author, must shift your perspective on the writing process a little bit. As you make updates and additions to <pubtitle>Sound Writing</pubtitle>, you shoul not ask yourself, <q>How do I want this bit of text to look?</q> rather, you should ask, <q>What <em>kind of text am I adding, structurally?</em></q></p>
        <p>Before diving into what all that vague philosophical mumbo<ndas/>jumbo actually means, let's consider a few counterexamples of good use of <pretext/> to show you how you might find a way to make the handbook <em>look</em> good without actually abiding by good authoring principles.</p>
        <example xml:id="ex-ag-tag-abuse-em">
            <title>It's all just italics, right?</title>
            <p>Suppose you're writing something, and you want to <em>really stress</em> the importance of a particular point. So you put it in italics, like we did. Great. Later, you're talking about your favorite book, <pubtitle>Harry Potter</pubtitle><fn>Yeah, like you're the <em>first person</em> in the <init>CWLT</init> whose favorite book is <pubtitle>Harry Potter</pubtitle><nbsp/><ellipsis/></fn>, so you put that in italics too. Only you <alert>don't</alert>. You're using italics for two different purposes, so because you're now thinking like an author in a markup language, you don't think <q>ah, I want them to both <em>be</em> italicized,</q> like you would if you were writing in <init>MS</init> Word. Instead, you noticed that the first use of italics (<q>really stress</q>) was <em>emphasizing</em> a point, so you used the <tag>em</tag> <term>tag</term> to indicate to the publisher of the handbook, <q>this text should stand apart because it is important for the reader to recognize it as important.</q> In theory, the publisher could decide that italics are gauche and make the calll to put all of the text that you said shoudl be emphasized in bold, rather than italics, and <em>that stylistic choice would not interfere with how you communicate content to your reader.</em></p>
            <p>In the second use of italics (<q>Harry Potter</q>), you were not emphasizing the title of a book, you were trying to follow the rule about italicizing the titles of books and similar publications. Again, this is a good way to think if you're writing in a program like Microsoft Word, but it's not a good way to think in a markup language because you focused on how you wanted something to look, not on what kind of text it was and <em>why</em> you wanted it to look a certain way. In this case, we want to make it clear to the reader that <pubtitle>Harry Potter</pubtitle> is a book, so we wrap it in the <tag>pubtitle</tag> tag. So even though <em>(1) Harry Potter</em> and <pubtitle>(2) Harry Potter</pubtitle> might both look the same right now, (1) has italics because it is emphasized, and (2) has italics because it is demarkated as a publication. If a future publisher decided that publications should be underlined, not italicized, (1) would not get this handbook<ndash/>wide style update because the author did not correctly take advantage of the fact that they were writing in a markup language.</p>

    <!-- You can insert comments into your code, and it's probably a good idea to do that, though what you include in a comment might vary. You can also comment OUT poritons of your code, which is a good way of removing code that you're not yet sure you want to get rid of (maybe you're testing out a new format for content but haven't gotten the boss's approval yet).

        <title>General Principles for Authoring <pubtitle>Sound Writing</pubtitle></title>
        <introduction>
            <p>This section is dedicated to general consistency principles that have been established after lots of careful thought about how the content of the handbook is structured overall.</p>
            <note>
                <p>In the <init>XML</init> markup language, content is categorized (and later formatted) based on how it is marked with <term><init>XML tags</init></term>. In most cases, you must <q>wrap</q> text in an opening tag and a closing tag, where the opening tag is a word in angle brackets (like this <tag>tag</tag>) and the closing tag is nearly identical but follows the opening bracket with a forward slash (like this <tag>/ tag</tag>). The one exception to this general principle is that some special keywords require only a single tag, so if you want to talk aobut the document markup language <latex/>, you need only write <tag>latex /</tag>. If you're using Sublime Text to edit the text of the handbook, you can automatically close any open tag by typing <c>&lt;/</c>; the program will autofill the closing tag for the most recently opened tag. Throughout this Author's Guide, whenever instructions are provided about using a tag, only the opening tag is provided. <alert>You should assume that a closing tag formatted as described above is also required.</alert></p>

            <title>Using Lists</title>
            <introduction>
                <p>
                    <pubtitle>Sound Writing</pubtitle> relies heavily on lists to convey content to the reader in an organized, aesthetically pleasing way. To reap the beneifits from this decision, it is important to adhere to the principles for what <em>kinds</em> of lists should be used in which scenarios, as well as how they should be formatted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In <pubtitle>Sound Writing</pubtitle>, you can use a list when<ellipsis/>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>defining a list of terms (See <q>Terms</q> at the bottom of the <url href="https://soundwriting.pugetsound.edu/lgbtq-inclusivity.html">LGBTQ+ Inclusivity</url> page.).</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>finishing a sentence many different ways (like this!).</p>

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><xref ref="general-principles-providing-guidelines"/>.</p>
                        </li>

                            <p>making a checklist, either with explanations of each item (see <url href="https://soundwriting.pugetsound.edu/argument-strong-argument.html">Making a Strong Argument</url>) or without.</p>

                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    If content that you want to put in a list doesn't fit one of these criteria, it may still be appropriate to use a list, but consider carefully whether there's a more appropriate way to display your content that's already being used in <pubtitle>Sound Writing</pubtitle> or another way to format your content to keep the handbook consistent.

                <title>Providing Guidelines, Strategies, or Rules</title>
                <introduction>
                    <p>Perhaps the most common use of lists in the handbook is to give the reader consolidated instructions about <em>what</em> to do or <em>how</em> to do something (it is a writing handbook, after all). Often, you will want to also explain <em>why</em> to do something, so the list structure must be flexibile enough to accomodate both long explanations and brief pointers about what the reader should do. You may, in your journey of authorship of the handbook, discover that you want your particular set of instructions to look different, but <alert>readers benefit from consistency</alert>. If you think that instructions in general should be formatted differently, you should update how lists look <em>everywhere</em>, and you should update these instructions.</p>

                    <title>Strategies for Providing Strategies in <pubtitle>Sound Writing</pubtitle></title>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p><em>Use a <tag>list</tag> as the outermost container for your set of instructions.</em></p>
                            <p>This tag is known as a <q>named list</q>, and can be cross<ndash/>referenced, given titles, and used to store description lists, ordered lists, and unordered lists alike.

                            <p>This consistency alerts readers right away to what kind of content they are about ot read. The choice of the term <q>strategies</q> as opposed to <q>guidelines</q> or <q>rules</q> is intentional<mdash/><pubtitle>Sound Writing</pubtitle> is authored primarily by students and is meant to be informative and reliable without being authoritative. Its goal is to explain norms that really impact writing, for better and for worse, without putting them on a pedestal as a moral good. The term <q>strategies</q> achieves this end because it leaves the reader with the agency to decide whether they want to employ each strategy depending on whether they want to achieve the outcome it leads to or not.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><em>Use an unordered list (<tag>ul</tag>) unless the order of the steps matters.</em></p>
                            <p>Unfortunately, doing this makes it impossible to cross<ndash/>reference individual items from your list, so you will have to reference the entire list if you wish to remind readers of a strategy that is elsewhere in the handbook. Treat this as a productive constraint and keep the focus of your strategies narrow and specific.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><em>Make the first sentence of each list item an <em>imperative</em> instruction<mdash/>it must be something that readers can <em>DO</em>, not just a fact.</em></p>
                            <p>To mark this imperative as distinct from the explanation, you should wrap the instruction in both emphasis (<tag>em</tag>) and a paragraph block (<tag>p</tag>). Subsequent explanation that clarifies the instruction should be placed in a separate paragraph block so that there is a clear visual distinction between the imperative and the explanation.</p>

                <p>
                    Another way that lists are used frequently is to provide the reader with a list of questions to consider. We format this list as follows:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>The outermost block is an <tag>assemblage</tag> that contains a <tag>title</tag> and a <tag>p</tag> that holds an unordered list (<tag>ul</tag>).</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>The <tag>title</tag> of the assemblage should be <q>Helpful Questions for <fillin/></q> where the blank is filled in with a specific gerund phrase.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Each list item within this structure should be a <alert>question</alert> and since each item is a question the reader should ask themselves (and nothing else), you should not use quotatiopn marks around the questions.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Each question should be written in <em>first<ndash/>person</em>, as in <q>Is what I'm writing going to be helpful to future authors?</q> not <q>Is what you're writing helpful to future authors?</q></p>

            <title>Using Assemblages</title>
            <introduction>
                <p>
                    Because of how aesthetically pleasing they are in breaking up large blocks of text, it can be tempting to use an <tag>assemblage</tag> haphazardly to commit the <pretext/> sin of authoring with aesthetics, rather than structure, in mind.
                </p>
                <assemblage>
                    <title>Sample Assemblage</title>
                    <p>
                        Doesn't this look nice and important? I bet you didn't even read the first paragraph of this introduction because the blue box just pulled your focus into this 100% frivolous text.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Anyway, an assemblage can have (but does not require) a <tag>title</tag> and was designed to be a simple, amorphous container for other simple blocks like <tag>p</tag>. Don't go crazy nesting structures within assemblages. You <alert>cannot cross<ndash/>reference an assemblage</alert> since it is not a <q>numbered</q> block.
                    </p>
                </assemblage>
                <p>
                    Whenever possible, you should only use an assemblage when<ellipsis/>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>you want a fact that you're explaining in a <tag>p</tag> to stand out as especially important.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>you are <xref ref="general-principles-providing-questions"/> (wrap the entire unnamed list in a <tag>p</tag> in the assemblage body).</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>you are highlighting a quote from a student, staff, or faculty member (this is used extensively in <url href="https://soundwriting.pugetsound.edu/awareness-inclusive-language.html">Inclusive Language</url>).</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <note>
                    <title>Preventing Tag Abuse of Assemblage</title>

                        Based on these guidelines, it will be tempting to use an assemblage to call attention to a <q>note</q> or <q>tip</q> that you want the reader to keep in mind, but you should use the <tag>note</tag> and <tag>insight</tag> (displays as <q>tip</q>) in those cases!

            <title>Cross<ndash/>Referencing Schema</title>
            <introduction>
            <p>To take advantage of cross<ndash/>referencing, which <pretext/> and a digital platform make easy, you will need to provide an <term>xml id</term> to every element that you wish to be able to cross<ndash/>reference. The beauty of this system is that if you change where a piece of cross<ndash/>referenced content is located, all of the reference links still work because you haven't changed the <c>xml:id</c>. This means that if you <em>do</em> change the <c>xml:id</c>, your links <alert>will</alert> break. You can find more on <url href="https://pretextbook.org/doc/author-guide/html/topic-cross-referencing.html">cross<ndash/>referencing</url> in the <url href="https://pretextbook.org/doc/author-guide/html/index.html"><pretext/> Author's Guide </url>, so here we only address the schema we (try to) use in <pubtitle>Sound Writing</pubtitle>.</p>

        <subsection xml:id="ag-narrative-offset">
            <title>Narrative Offset Elements (Remark<ndash/>Like)</title>
            <introduction>
                <p>
                    One capability that you as an author should look to implement is the possibility for <pretext/> to intersperse the text with a handful of <q>remark<ndash/>like</q> elements that belong to the same <q>class.</q> All of these elements follow the same <q>programming rules,</q> so anything that you can do with one of the elements, you can do with any of them (and conversely anything that doesn't work in one won't work in any of the others either). Each element can be formatted differently, however, so you can easily call your reader's attention to the different kinds of content that you're sharing with them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are six <q>remark<ndash/>like</q> elements you can use: <tag>remark</tag>, <tag>convention</tag>, <tag>note</tag>, <tag>observation</tag>, <tag>warning</tag>, and <tag>insight</tag> (tip). So far, we have implemented <xref ref="element-formatting-note"/> and <xref ref="element-formatting-insight"/> and provided rules for using each of them. You are encouraged to find ways to incorporate more remark<ndash/>like elements into the handbook; however, <em>you must also identify a structural role that the element fills</em> and provide guidelines to future authors for how to use the element in a consistent way.

                <p>
                    A <tag>note</tag> captures text that doesn't flow with the narrative arc of the text you're writing but that you consider essential for readers to know. You do not need to give your note a <tag>title</tag><mdash/>it should just display the text <q>Note.</q> without any numbering.

                <p>
                    Because offering <q>tips</q> is common practice in all sorts of guides, we have renamed the <tag>insight</tag> tag to display as a <q>tip</q> instead. You should only call something a <q>tip</q> and use the <tag>insight</tag> tag when the advice you're giving the reader can truly be heeded or disregarded without impacting the reader's success. So <q>make a <init>CWLT</init> appointment for the week before your paper is due so you're accountable for starting it!</q> is an appropriate tip because it recommends an <em>optional method</em> for achieving a goal. <q>Start your paper early!</q> is <em>not</em> a good tip because following this advice is an expectation, not a <q>system hack.</q>

                    <p>Here's another hot tip for you (this time without a title): sprinkle the handbook with easily<ndash/>formatted REMARK-LIKE structures so that the writing handbook looks like the instructional equivalent of dessert and not a droll pile of boring additional reading!</p>

                <title>Warning</title>
                <warning>
                    As a rhetorical device, the <tag>warning</tag> tag/block/environment verges on too authoritarian for this handbook. Don't let the power go to your head; this handbook is still meant to be student<ndash/>authored and to give students agency with and control over language by laying bare the unerlying rules without acting all hign<ndash/>and<ndash/>mighty about it.
                </warning>
                <p>You are encouraged to use a <tag>warning</tag> to call the reader's attention to an <em>essential action</em>. Here's a heuristic for figuring out when to use a warning: While you might use an <tag>insight</tag> (tip) to <em>suggest a method</em> to a reader and a <tag>note</tag> to provide essential information that the reader needs to know to succeed, a <tag>warning</tag> is slightly stronger<mdash/>it is an action that the reader <em>must</em> take to succeed. It is especially effective to use the warning environment when you have just explained something to the reader that might lead them down a dangerous path. Say you're writing a section about how physics is about building up understanding of the world from a minimal set of first principles. Your reader might be pretty into that, and you wouldn't want them to get into trouble <ellipsis/></p>
                <warning>
                    <title>Elitism</title>
                    <p>Physics <em>does</em> value a perspective of building efficient models from <q>first principles,</q> but don't act like other disciplines are worthless or that you can <q>figure out</q> an entire academic discipline after taking an intro class just because you're a physics major. This attitude is incorrect, and it's especially socially costly to walk around Wyatt talking like that <ellipsis/>.</p>

                <title>Overall Structure</title>
                <p>Sections in this chapter are written in close collaboration with faculty members in the department that the section covers. Typically, the student handbook author interviews faculty members and then writes the contents of the section based on what faculty members say in those interviews. A completed draft is presented to the department for approval, and upon receiving approval, it is put into the handbook in its final version.</p>
                <p>Each section begins with a brief introduction about what makes writing in a particular discipline difficult and is followed by a <tag>note</tag> with the following text: <q>Unless otherwise stated, all quotes throughout this section are excerpted from the interview with <fillin/> faculty members that informed this section.</q> The remainder of the section is broken into <tag>paragraphs</tag> titled <q>Genres,</q> <q>Purpose,</q> <q>Traits and Characteristics,</q> <q>Evidence,</q> <q>Conventions and Tips,</q> and <q>Additional Resources.</q> When relevant, the first sentence after the <tag>title</tag> of each paragraph should be a quote by a faculty member excerpted from the informational interview that informed the section. This quote should be in quotation marks (<tag>q</tag>) <em>and</em> italicized with emphasis (<tag>em</tag>).</p>

                    <p>Look up an online link<ndash/>checker and run it on the public version of <pubtitle>Sound Writing</pubtitle> to make sure that all of our hyperlinks are still functional. This is especially important to do <alert>after the Puget Sound website overhaul scheduled for spring 2020</alert>. Also, remember that this check will only return <em>broken</em> links, not links that still work but refer to old or outdated information.</p>

                    <p>7.4.2 Capitalization list is a long, complicated list that could use some kind of revision for (1) consistency with how we use lists, and (2) more effective juxtaposition of when to and when not to capitalize when the rules seem blurry.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>7.1.2 <q>Phrases</q> is a description list with examples built in. Could be reformatted to be more similar to <q>Clauses</q> above. Something should be done to minimize incorporation of examples into the text as has been done (plus more kinds of phrases should be defined); however, it's hard to tell whether the example sentences are essential for understanding the content of SW or not.</p>
