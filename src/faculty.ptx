        <title>Homophone errors</title>
        <p><term>Homophones</term> are words that sound the same but have different meanings and spellings. Because homophones share the same pronunciations (or sound similar), they are commonly confused in writing, especially when you know the spelling of one homophone but intend to convey the other. Below is a list of commonly-confused homophones and some example sentences using them. But if you are unsure of a word and it's not listed here, try looking it up in a dictionary or thesaurus to make sure it's the word you want!</p>

        <title>Incorrect use of its and it's</title>
        <figure>
            <image source="images/LM-ItAndRain"/>
        </figure>
        <p>One of the more common homophone errors writers make is between <q>its</q> and <q>it's.</q> While they sound the same, <q>its</q> is the possessive pronoun of <q>it</q> and <q>it's</q> is the contraction of <q>it is.</q> One way to differentiate them is to identify why you are using one version or the other. <q>Its</q> is used to convey possession by an inanimate object, action, idea, animal, group, or person whose gender is overlooked, as in the sentence <q>The dog bounded happily toward its owner on Todd Field.</q> <q>It's</q> with an apostrophe is used to indicate <q>it is</q> or the past tense <q>it was,</q> as in the sentences <q>It's [it is] a universally-acknowledged belief that a dog is a human's best friend,</q> or <q>It's [it has] been great getting to know all the dogs that frequent campus.</q> If you are trying to figure out which form to use, try splitting <q>its</q> into <q>it is</q> or <q>it was</q> and see if the sentence still makes sense. For instance, the sentence <q>The dog bounded happily toward it is owner on Todd Field,</q> does not make very much sense, so this may be an indication that <q>it's</q> is being used as a contraction and therefore needs an apostrophe. Below are some sentence examples of <q>its</q> and <q>it's</q> to help you distinguish which form to use:</p>

            <p>It's important to remember that contractions (such as <q>it's</q>) are informal and generally not appropriate in academia and should rarely be used in formal academic writing (such as lab reports, analytical essays, etc.). HOWEVER: the use of <q>it's</q> depends on the discipline, professor, writing assignment, and your own creative and scholarly voice, so don't be afraid to employ it intentionally as you see fit.</p>

        <title>Empty and imprecise statements</title>
        <p>When you have what you believe to be a brilliant idea and a strong argument, it is sometimes tempting to try to sound impressive by using a lot of words. More is better, right? Not necessarily! If more words and specialized vocabulary will make your meaning more clear to a specific audience, then it's worth it to use longer, more complex wording. But if complicated language makes the sentence (and your point) more confusing, it's better to state your ideas simply. Here are some examples of long-winded ways to say relatively simple things:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><p><q>At this juncture in time<nbsp/><ellipsis/></q> <m>\rightarrow</m> now, currently</p></li>
            <li><p><q>By virtue of the fact<nbsp/><ellipsis/></q> <m>\rightarrow</m> because</p></li>
            <li><p><q>For the purpose of<nbsp/><ellipsis/></q> <m>\rightarrow</m> to</p></li>
            <li><p><q>In all likelihood<nbsp/><ellipsis/></q> <m>\rightarrow</m> probably</p></li>
            <li><p><q>In the event that<nbsp/><ellipsis/></q> <m>\rightarrow</m> if</p></li>
            <li><p><q>In this regard, it is of significance that<nbsp/><ellipsis/></q> <m>\rightarrow</m> simply omit and get on with your sentence</p></li>
            <li><p><q>The truth is that<nbsp/><ellipsis/></q>  <m>\rightarrow</m>  simply omit and get on with your sentence</p></li>
            <li><p><q>Until such time as</q> <m>\rightarrow</m> until</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p>These kinds of empty phrases do not improve your writing and only add a tiny bit to the length of your paper (and length probably isn't the most important thing your professor wanted you to produce, anyhow). If you're hoping to sound scholarly, look closely at the precise and specific scholarly language that is used in your discipline.</p>

        <title>Inappropriate use of the passive voice</title>
        <p>The <term>passive voice</term> is <em>passive</em> because sentences in this structure de-emphasize the role of the actor in a sentence. An active sentence puts the actor front and center (<q>Sally hugged Barbara</q>) whereas a passive sentence holds the actor less prominently and places the action/object acted upon front and center (<q>Barbara was hugged by Sally</q>). The active sentence emphasizes Sally as the actor, whereas the passive sentence emphasizes that Barbara received a hug. Note that passive constructions can only occur in sentences with <term>transitive verbs</term>, which take direct objects. Here are some examples of active versus passive voice:</p>
        <dl>
            <li>
                <title>Active</title>
                <p><q>Sally hugged Barbara.</q></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <title>Passive</title>
                <p><q>Barbara was hugged by Sally.</q></p>
            </li>
            <li/>
            <li>
                <title>Active</title>
                <p><q>I did my homework.</q></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <title>Passive</title>
                <p><q>My homework was done by me.</q></p>
            </li>
            <li/>
            <li>
                <title>Active</title>
                <p><q>My roommate woke me up as she got ready for crew practice.</q></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <title>Passive</title>
                <p><q>I was woken up by my roommate as she got ready for crew practice.</q></p>
            </li>
            <li/>
            <li>
                <title>Active</title>
                <p><q>We made mistakes.</q></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <title>Passive</title>
                <p><q>Mistakes were made.</q></p>
                <p>(Notice how this form completely omits the actor<mdash/>Who made the mistakes? We don't know! They just were made<ellipsis/>)</p>
            </li>
        </dl>
        <figure>
            <image source="images/LM-PassiveVoice"/>
        </figure>
        <p>Below are some ways you can identify the passive voice. Please note that these tips are general guidelines, not concrete characteristics of every instance of passive voice.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p><em>Look for <q>to be</q> verbs.</em> The passive voice is often constructed in this format: <em><q>to be</q> + past participle.</em> Notice that the previous sentence is passive. It has <q>is</q> as the form of <q>to be</q> and <q>constructed</q> as the past participle.</p></li>
            <li><p><em>Look for <q>by</q> + a noun/pronoun/proper noun.</em> As with the example <q>Barbara was hugged by Sally,</q> passive sentences often use the word <q>by</q> to show that someone or something carried out the action. Barbara wasn't <em>just</em> hugged, she was hugged <em>by Sally.</em></p></li>
            <li><p>While the passive voice is not grammatically incorrect, most readers (and professors) prefer the active voice because readers generally want to identify the action happening in a piece of writing. Since the active voice makes it easier to identify what is happening and who or what is acting, the active voice usually makes more sense as a writing style. Similarly, the active voice also clarifies the meaning of and give more detail about a sentence. Consider these examples:</p>
            <dl>
                <li>
                    <title>Passive</title>
                    <p><q>We were asked by the flight attendant to have our luggage put in the overhead compartment by a man next to us who went by the name of Jim.</q></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <title>Active</title>
                    <p><q>The flight attendant asked us to have Jim, the man sitting next to us, put our luggage in the overhead compartment.</q></p>
                </li>
            </dl>
            <p>In both examples, there are three main people: us (the writer), the flight attendant, and Jim. The first example, the one in the passive voice, becomes long and confusing. The reader will have forgotten who asked whom to do what by the time Jim's name comes up. The second example, however, more clearly explains the scenario because there is less confusion about who is doing what.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <assemblage>
            <p>The large exception to these preferences is science. Most scientific work tends to be written in the passive voice. An active version of the previous sentence would be, <q>Most scientists tend to write in the passive voice.</q> Notice how the first version, the passive one, takes the actor out of the sentence completely. Who does the passive writing in the sciences? The active version answers that question: scientists write in the passive voice in science writing. Sciences tend to use the passive voice to distance the scientist from the science being done. The passive voice is therefore used strategically by the sciences. (Again, the previous sentence could also be active: <q>The sciences (or scientists) therefore use the passive voice strategically.</q>)</p>

        <title>Overuse of <q>to be</q></title>
        <p>While we use <q>to be</q> frequently in our everyday speech, the verb is often too weak as the main verb in formal writing. Uses of <q>to be</q> include: <em>to be, being, am, is, are, was, and were.</em></p>
        <p>Writers prefer not to overuse <q>to be</q> because English contains plenty of stronger (i.e. more active, informative, and interesting) verbs. <q>To be</q> also frequently indicates that you are using passive voice. (See item number nine on this list.) Using <q>to be</q> too much thus makes your writing boring or too passive. Which passage below do you prefer?</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><q>I was going to Diversions when I saw something that was interesting. It was my friend, Sally. Sally was outside and was sleeping on her chemistry textbook.</q></p>
            <p><q>On my way to Diversions, I happened upon an interesting (and funny) sight: my friend, Sally, had fallen asleep outside, using her chemistry textbook as a pillow!</q></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Try using a thesaurus to find alternative words. But use caution! Sometimes thesauruses mislead writers when the writer doesn't fully understand the connotation or typical uses of a synonym.</p>
        <p>Here's a list of strong verbs to consider using. There are short definitions to give you an idea of what the word means, but be sure to look up any words you use to make sure that the contexts in which you're using them align with their meaning. There may also be alternative meanings that aren't listed here, so the dictionary and thesaurus will still be your friends.</p>

        <title>Incorrect and ineffective word choice</title>
        <p>Strong word choice improves the quality of a paper and helps hold the reader's interest; inversely, using words incorrectly or ineffectively can lessen the writer's credibility. As you entrain for forthcoming linguistic endeavors, exploit these pointers to ensure your belles-lettres aren't as annoying and incorrect as this sentence has been.</p>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Incorrect word choice</title>
            <p>Incorrect word choice usually occurs when a writer uses a word outside of its standard definition or context. This misuse can happen for a variety of reasons, including the writer having a wrong mental definition of the word, not knowing the word's popular connotation, or using the word in an inappropriate disciplinary context.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <p>How to avoid misusing words:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><p>If there's a word that comes to mind when you're writing and you're not completely sure of its meaning, err on the side of caution and look it up! (We, for example,  just looked up <q>err</q> to make sure that was the right word to use.)</p></li>
            <li><p>If you select a word from a thesaurus, make sure to also look the word up in a dictionary (online, of course). The dictionary definition and example sentences will help you catch any connotations or standard uses of the word that you might not otherwise be familiar with.</p></li>
            <li><p>When writing in a specific discipline, it can be difficult to know what words are specific to that discipline and how they are used differently in academic writing than they are in standard, everyday conversation. In statistics, for example, <em><q>significant</q></em> has a very specific meaning (i.e., having statistical importance), and any other uses of the word are incorrect and generally avoided. Similarly, <em><q>conjugation</q></em> has a very different meaning in biology than it does in Spanish. So how do you avoid misusing words in disciplines with which you are unfamiliar? First, do your course readings! Second, know that you can't avoid every mistake, but that professors can help guide you. Reading scholarly work in a discipline you're studying is also an invaluable tool for learning that discipline's jargon and linguistic preferences.</p></li>
            <li><p>See the <q>Homophone Errors</q> section above to avoid misusing words that sound alike.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Ineffective word choice</title>
            <p>While academic writing usually employs more abstruse and sophisticated language than you find in everyday conversation, sometimes using <q>big words</q> simply to sound smart can come across to an audience as pedantic. Words that are overly complicated and obfuscate the meaning of a sentence are therefore ineffective; if the point of writing is to convey meaning clearly, a confusing word should not get in the way of that meaning.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <p><em>Alternatively, using words or phrases that are too simplistic, overused, or trite can also ineffectively convey meaning to a reader.</em> Passive sentences, phrases constructed around <q>to be,</q> and clichés like <q>to be honest</q> all diminish the point you're trying to convey to a reader.</p>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Which sentence below do you think is more effective?</title>
            <blockquote>
                <p><q>To be honest, I didn't think that Hamlet was played by the right actor.</q></p>
                <p><q>The actor who played Hamlet fell five times on stage, broke poor Yorick's skull, and forgot his lines during the <q>To be, or not to be<ellipsis/></q> speech. The directors of the play should have chosen a better actor to play Hamlet.</q></p>

        <title>Problems with subject/verb agreement</title>
        <p>Any student of a foreign language knows that consistent subject and verb agreement can be a pain. Even in a first language, writers and speakers alike can confuse whether a word is singular or plural (a group?<mdash/>hint: it's singular) or<mdash/>in the middle of complex sentences<mdash/>forget whether the subject of their sentence was singular or plural. Thankfully, we have the opportunity to revise when we write!</p>
        <p>Here are a few rules to help guide you through tricky sentences:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>When the subject of a sentence is comprised of two or more nouns/pronouns connected by <q>and,</q> use a plural verb:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><q>President Crawford and professors meet with students frequently.</q></p>
                </blockquote>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When the subject of a sentence is comprised of two or more nouns/pronouns connected by <q>or</q> or <q>nor,</q> the <em>verb corresponds with the noun or pronoun closest to it:</em></p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><q>Either President Crawford or professors meet with students frequently.</q></p>
                    <p><q>Either professors or President Crawford meets with students frequently.</q></p>
                </blockquote>
            </li>
            <li>

        <p>There are also some English words, especially in the sciences, that have tricky plural forms, so you might not even realize that the word you're using is actually plural. One great example is the word <em>data</em>, which is plural (<em><q>The data suggest that<ellipsis/></q></em>). Other examples include criteria/criterion, media/medium, and phenomena/phenomenon.</p>

            <p>As you can observe in the "Top 10 "Errors" that are Actually Rule-Bound" list in Chapter 11, what may seem like problems with subject/verb agreement might actually be <em>correct</em> subject/verb agreement in another variety of English.

        <title>Lack of agreement between pronoun and antecedent, especially the use of <q>they</q> as a singular pronoun</title>
        <p>Problems with agreement occur most commonly when a writer mentions a subject, a movie director, for example, and then uses a pronoun (recall: he, she, they, it) to refer back to that subject. When the subject's gender is unspecified, it is unclear whether the subject (in this case, the director) should be referred to as <q>he</q> or <q>she.</q> Because the plural pronoun <q>they</q> is gender-neutral, many writers, consciously or not, opt to use <q>they</q> instead of <q>he,</q> <q>she,</q> or the more cumbersome phrase <q>he or she.</q> (see <xref ref="basic-sentence-structure" autoname="title"/>)</p>
        <p>A sentence using <q>they</q> but referring to a singular pronoun looks like this:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><q>I liked what the director of the movie did. They did a good job.</q></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In terms of grammatical correctness, formal, standard <xref ref="SAE">English</xref> requires writers to make the correct agreement between a pronoun and its antecedent (i.e. you have to use a singular pronouns for singular antecedents). For a gender-unspecified singular antecedent, then, a writer has a few options: to use the phrase <q>he or she,</q> to make the subject plural if possible, or to avoid the issue altogether by restructuring the sentence. A sentence of this sort would therefore take one of these three forms:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><p><q>I liked what the director of the movie did. He or she did a good job.</q></p></li>
            <li><p><q>That movie had a good director. When directors pay special attention to lighting like this director did, they are doing a good job.</q></p></li>
            <li><p><q>That movie was great! I can't believe how well the director focused on light!</q></p></li>
        </ol>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Note</title>
            <p>It was formerly appropriate to use the pronoun <q>he</q> as the default, but using <q>he</q> as a standard is no longer accepted.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>But here's the deal: language changes</title>
            <p>You are living through an important and interesting time in the progression of the English language. <q>Formal</q> and <q>standard</q> English (among most other languages) has historically belonged to people in power, people who have used (and still use) language to discriminate against and subjugate individuals who speak non-standard forms of English. In spite of this subjugation, speakers of English<mdash/>standard and non-standard<mdash/>are beginning to gain power and to reclaim English from those who use it to oppress. Since language and power are intimately intertwined, shifts in power inevitably lead to subsequent shifts in language. These shifts explain why it is now inappropriate to use <q>he</q> as the default pronoun and why <q>they</q> is becoming increasingly accepted as a gender-neutral, third-person singular pronoun. While conservative grammarians may lament the devolution of <q>proper English,</q> the reality is that language belongs to its speakers, not to those in power. By acknowledging these shifts in language (and the reasons behind them) within academia, we work toward increasing the access to and inclusivity of the academy. What inevitably follows are new perspectives, experiences, and identities that may lead to even greater equity among scholars and the types of knowledge they produce.</p>

        <title>Broad use of <q>this,</q> especially as the subject of a sentence</title>
        <p>Readers like specificity. Using <q>this</q> too much, especially as the subject of a sentence (e.g. <q>This is what I'm talking about.</q>) conveys too much ambiguity. To what does <q>this</q> refer? Instead of writing <q>this,</q> try to use an interesting word that refers specifically to what you want to talk about. For example, I could write an essay about my dog, Chuck, and say, <q>Chuck likes to take walks. This is why I walk him everyday.</q> To avoid using <q>this</q> as the subject of the sentence, though, I could say something like: <q>Chuck likes to take walks. I walk him everyday because he loves walks so much.</q> In this sentence, <q>this</q> is replaced by <q>because he loves walks so much.</q></p>
        <p>You can also simply restructure the sentence(s) to avoid using <q>this</q> as the subject. From the example above, I could also say, <q>Chuck likes to take walks, so I walk him everyday.</q> Finally, you can think of a noun that tells your reader what <q>this</q> is referring to: <em>this</em> quote, <em>this</em> information, <em>this</em> verdict, <em>this</em> distinction, <em>this</em> occurrence, <em>this</em> sentiment, <etc/></p>

        <title>Sentence fragments</title>
        <p>Sentence fragments are incomplete sentences. Like here. That sentence is not a complete sentence because it cannot stand on its own and make sense. (see <xref ref="basic-sentence-structure" autoname="title"/>)</p>
        <p>So how do you avoid sentence fragments?</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Ensure that your sentence has a subject and a verb and that it expresses a complete thought.</p></li>
            <li><p>Word processing programs can help you to identify fragments--but don't depend on them!</p></li>
            <li><p>Mentally take your sentence out of context, then ask yourself, <em><q>Does this sentence alone make sense?</q></em></p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you do find a sentence fragment, try these two revision tips:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Add the necessary components of a sentence that the fragment is missing.</p></li>
            <li><p>Combine the sentence fragment with another sentence.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Examples of sentence fragments and revisions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p><q>To the <acro>SUB</acro>.</q> <m>\rightarrow</m> <q>You should take your <acro>SUB</acro> dishes back to the <acro>SUB</acro>.</q> In this revision, we combine the fragment with the independent clause, <q>You should take your <acro>SUB</acro> dishes back.</q> By sticking the fragment on an independent clause, we not only get rid of the fragment, but we also add more specificity to the sentence.</p></li>
            <li><p><q>All night long!</q> <m>\rightarrow</m> <q>I was in the library all night long!</q> Just like the previous example, this fix gets rid of the fragment and makes the sentence more specific. <q>How long were you in the library?</q> <q>I was in the library all night long!</q></p></li>

        <title>Comma splices</title>
        <p><term>Comma splices</term> occur when a writer joins two independent clauses with a comma (see <xref ref="basic-sentence-structure" autoname="title"/>). Recall that an independent clause is a sentence with a subject, verb, and complete idea. <em><q>Comma splices are weird, they look like this.</q> </em>Comma splices make sentences less precise, can you see how this comma splice makes my sentence quite confused?</p>
        <p>What can you do instead? You have several options!</p>
        <ol>
            <li><p>You can keep the sentences as they are and replace the comma with a semicolon. This option works for sentences that are too closely related for a period but for which a coordinating conjunction would be inappropriate. (For example, <em><q>I like cats; they are cute.</q></em>)</p></li>
            <li><p>You can split the clauses into two sentences: <em><q>Comma splices make sentences less precise. Can you see how the absence of a comma splice improves my sentence(s)?</q></em></p></li>
            <li><p>You can put a coordinating conjunction (see <xref ref="parts-of-speach" autoname="yes"/>) after the comma and before the second clause: <em><q>I love using commas, <em>but</em> I know that they don't belong between two independent clauses without a conjunction.</q></em></p></li>
            <li><p>You can alter the clauses so that one is no longer an independent clause: <em><q>Comma splices aren't great, which is why I don't use them.</q></em></p></li>
            <li><p>Finally, if possible, you can also combine the idea into one sentence/independent clause: <em><q>I don't use comma splices.</q></em></p></li>

        <title>Incorrect use of apostrophes</title>
        <p>Apostrophes, or single quotation marks, most often mark possession. However, due to the inconsistent nature of English morphology, the task of marking possession is rather complicated. To indicate possession for<ellipsis/></p>

                <p>[Bus] + ['] (+ [s]) = Bus' or Bus's</p>

        <p>Apostrophes are also used to mark contractions, or two words, such as <q>could</q> and <q>have,</q> which can be contracted, or shortened, to <q>could've.</q> A single apostrophe takes the place of omitted letters.</p>
        <ul cols="2">
            <li><p>Can't</p></li>
            <li><p>We'd</p></li>
            <li><p>It's</p></li>
            <li><p>Won't</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p><q>Won't</q> is an interesting case because its spelling does not correspond to its implied contraction <q>will not.</q> Linguists suspect that this is because, over time, the pronunciation of the contraction shifted such that <q>will</q> became <q>woll,</q> resulting in the current form <q>won't.</q> It should be noted that the above contractions constitute their own words without an apostrophe (cant, wed, its, and wont are all words). In order to avoid confusion, it is important to include the apostrophe in contractions.</p>
        <p>Apostrophes can also come at the front of a word, such as <q>'Twas</q> to mark omitted letters (omitted from <q>'Twas</q> is the letter <q>I</q>: <q>It was</q>).</p>
        <p>Apostrophes can also be used in conjunction with single letters (such as grades), abbreviations, and numerals (including years). There are no standard rules for these usages. Ask your professor for their preference and be consistent. Aim for clarity where necessary. For instance, the plural form <q>As</q> (referring to the letter grade) will likely be misread as <q>As</q> the word. Use an apostrophe here (<q>A's</q>).</p>
        <p>Generally accepted usages:</p>
        <ul cols="2">
            <li><p>Ph.D.s</p></li>

        <title>Incorrect capitalization</title>
        <p>If English were a more consistent language, capitalization might not be such a pain. Unfortunately, it's not, though there are some general guidelines that can help you to decide whether a word should be capitalized or not.</p>
        <p>General guidelines:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Proper nouns should be capitalized.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Proper nouns are basically names, though they aren't limited to humans.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Proper nouns name things ranging from schools (University of Puget Sound) to coffee shops (Diversions Café) to anthropomorphized bears (Grizz).</p></li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Chances are, if it specifies a particular thing as opposed to that thing in general (University of Puget Sound v. college), capitalize it!</p>
                        <p>That said, there are many variables to consider and many exceptions. If you're unsure about whether or not to capitalize races like <q>black</q> and <q>white,</q> on which there is no consensus, ask. (Also, see <xref ref="writing-with-awareness" autoname="yes"/> where we discuss this issue further.)</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Professional titles should be capitalized only when they precede the title-holder's name.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Capitalize <q>president</q> in the sentence <q>President Isaiah Crawford joined the university in 2016.</q></p></li>
                    <li><p>Do not capitalize <q>president</q> in the sentence <q>The 14th president of the University of Puget Sound is Isaiah Crawford.</q></p></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>But don't capitalize occupational designators!</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>The university's mascot Grizz</p></li>
                    <li><p>The movie's director Christopher Nolan</p></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>What about <q>professor?</q></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Would it be <q>I asked professor Julie Nelson Christoph a question about capitalization</q> or <q>I asked Professor Julie Nelson Christoph a question about capitalization</q>?</p></li>
                    <li><p>There are different theories about <q>professor,</q> which makes it, and others like it, problematic. There is, of course, no clear answer. In this case, it would be better to ask.</p></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Capitalize formal titles when the title is used to address someone.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p><q>Hello, Admiral.</q></p></li>
                    <li><p><q>How was your day, Admiral?</q></p></li>
                    <li><p>How arbitrary is this rule? Unfortunately, Google does not provide a gradient that will tell you how formal a given title is. It is relatively safe to assume that a title such as <q>Admiral</q> is formal enough to be capitalized, while a title such as <q>mister</q> is more ambiguous. The lack of a standard will likely cause some confusion at some point in your college career. Once again, do not be afraid to ask.</p></li>

                    <p>Knowing what to capitalize in titles can be incredibly confusing and frustrating. Different styles have their own policies, so consult the official stylebooks for the style in which you're writing. In general, when capitalizing, it is usually safe to capitalize:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>The title's first word</p></li>
                        <li><p>Adjectives, adverbs, pronouns, nouns, proper nouns, and verbs (except the <q>to</q> in infinitives)</p></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>It is usually safe not to capitalize:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Articles (a, an, the)</p></li>
                        <li><p>Coordinating conjunctions (and, or, but, for, yet, so, nor)</p></li>

                </li>
                <li><p>It is also fairly painless to find a capitalization automator online, which will capitalize your title according to the stylesheet you choose. (Google search <q>Capitalize my title.</q>)</p></li>

            <title>Citations that are misleading because titles are denoted inaccurately</title>
            <p>Titles are typically indicated in one of two ways: quotation marks or italics.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Quotation marks are generally used for shorter works, including articles, poems, songs, chapters, short stories, short films, and essays.</p></li>
                <li><p>Italics are generally used for longer works, including books, plays, long poems, music albums, anthologies, magazines, newspapers, full-length films, shows, symphonies, works of plastic and visual art, and court cases.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Sometimes, titles are not typographically distinguished. Titles that do not generally require special formatting include specific scripture of major religions (the Bible, the Torah), constitutional documents (the Constitution of the United States of America), and legal documents (the Civil Rights Act of 1964).</p>
            <assemblage>
                <p>As always, if you're unsure about the correct way to denote a title, ask a professor, a liaison librarian, or a writing advisor!</p>
