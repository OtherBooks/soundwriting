    <title>Authoring and Styling Guide for <pubttile>Sound Writing</pubttile></title>
    <introduction>
        <p>This <q>chapter</q> of <pubtitle>Sound Writing</pubtitle> is meant to help future authors, editors, and <q>publishers</q> of the handbook make content additions and updates in a consistent way. Unlike text editing programs like Microsoft Word or Pages, <pretext/> is a <term>markup langugae</term>, which means that portions of text can be demarkated as <em>being a specific kind of text</em>, and formatting for how that text should be displayed can be determined for the <em>whole document</em> based on what the text is, strucuturally, rather than on how an author wants a particualr title to look in a specific instance. This approach to writing is perhaps unfamiliar to you (and probably feels limiting) if you normally write with programs like Word or Pages that let you individually control font, font size, indentation, stylistic elements, <etc/> on a case<ndash/>by<ndash/>case basis; however, the advantage of using a markup language is that it is easy to make document<ndash/>wide stylistic modifications quickly and consistently. To take advantage of these benifits, you, the author, must shift your perspective on the writing process a little bit. As you make updates and additions to <pubtitle>Sound Writing</pubtitle>, you shoul not ask yourself, <q>How do I want this bit of text to look?</q> rather, you should ask, <q>What <em>kind of text am I adding, structurally?</em></q></p>
        <p>Before diving into what all that vague philosophical mumbo<ndas/>jumbo actually means, let's consider a few counterexamples of good use of <pretext/> to show you how you might find a way to make the handbook <em>look</em> good without actually abiding by good authoring principles.</p>
        <example xml:id="ex-ag-tag-abuse-em">
            <title>It's all just italics, right?</title>
            <p>Suppose you're writing something, and you want to <em>really stress</em> the importance of a particular point. So you put it in italics, like we did. Great. Later, you're talking about your favorite book, <pubtitle>Harry Potter</pubtitle><fn>Yeah, like you're the <em>first person</em> in the <init>CWLT</init> whose favorite book is <pubtitle>Harry Potter</pubtitle><nbsp/><ellipsis/></fn>, so you put that in italics too. Only you <alert>don't</alert>. You're using italics for two different purposes, so because you're now thinking like an author in a markup language, you don't think <q>ah, I want them to both <em>be</em> italicized,</q> like you would if you were writing in <init>MS</init> Word. Instead, you noticed that the first use of italics (<q>really stress</q>) was <em>emphasizing</em> a point, so you used the <tag>em</tag> <term>tag</term> to indicate to the publisher of the handbook, <q>this text should stand apart because it is important for the reader to recognize it as important.</q> In theory, the publisher could decide that italics are gauche and make the calll to put all of the text that you said shoudl be emphasized in bold, rather than italics, and <em>that stylistic choice would not interfere with how you communicate content to your reader.</em></p>
            <p>In the second use of italics (<q>Harry Potter</q>), you were not emphasizing the title of a book, you were trying to follow the rule about italicizing the titles of books and similar publications. Again, this is a good way to think if you're writing in a program like Microsoft Word, but it's not a good way to think in a markup language because you focused on how you wanted something to look, not on what kind of text it was and <em>why</em> you wanted it to look a certain way. In this case, we want to make it clear to the reader that <pubtitle>Harry Potter</pubtitle> is a book, so we wrap it in the <tag>pubtitle</tag> tag. So even though <em>(1) Harry Potter</em> and <pubtitle>(2) Harry Potter</pubtitle> might both look the same right now, (1) has italics because it is emphasized, and (2) has italics because it is demarkated as a publication. If a future publisher decided that publications should be underlined, not italicized, (1) would not get this handbook<ndash/>wide style update because the author did not correctly take advantage of the fact that they were writing in a markup language.</p>

    <!-- You can insert comments into your code, and it's probably a good idea to do that, though what you include in a comment might vary. You can also comment OUT poritons of your code, which is a good way of removing code that you're not yet sure you want to get rid of (maybe you're testing out a new format for content but haven't gotten the boss's approval yet).

        <title>General Principles for Authoring <pubtitle>Sound Writing</pubtitle></title>
        <introduction>
            <p>This section is dedicated to general consistency principles that have been established after lots of careful thought about how the content of the handbook is structured overall.</p>
            <note>
                <p>In the <init>XML</init> markup language, content is categorized (and later formatted) based on how it is marked with <term><init>XML tags</init></term>. In most cases, you must <q>wrap</q> text in an opening tag and a closing tag, where the opening tag is a word in angle brackets (like this <tag>tag</tag>) and the closing tag is nearly identical but follows the opening bracket with a forward slash (like this <tag>/tag</tag>). The one exception to this general principle is that some special keywords require only a single tag, so if you want to talk aobut the document markup language <latex/>, you need only write <tag>latex/</tag>. If you're using Sublime Text to edit the text of the handbook, you can automatically close any open tag by typing <c>&lt;/</c>; the program will autofill the closing tag for the most recently opened tag. Throughout this Author's Guide, whenever instructions are provided about using a tag, only the opening tag is provided. <alert>You should assume that a closing tag formatted as described above is also required.</alert></p>

            <title>Using Lists</title>
            <introduction>
                <p>
                    <pubtitle>Sound Writing</pubtitle> relies heavily on lists to convey content to the reader in an organized, aesthetically pleasing way. To reap the beneifits from this decision, it is important to adhere to the principles for what <em>kinds</em> of lists should be used in which scenarios, as well as how they should be formatted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In <pubtitle>Sound Writing</pubtitle>, you can use a list when<ellipsis/>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>defining a list of terms (See <q>Terms</q> at the bottom of the <url href="https://soundwriting.pugetsound.edu/lgbtq-inclusivity.html">LGBTQ+ INclusivity</url> page.).</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>finishing a sentence many different ways (like this!).</p>

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><xref ref="general-principles-providing-guidelines"/>.</p>
                        </li>

                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    If content that you want to put in a list doesn't fit one of these criteria, it may still be appropriate to use a list, but consider carefully whether there's a more appropriate way to display your content that's already being used in <pubtitle>Sound Writing</pubtitle> or another way to format your content to keep the handbook consistent.

                <title>Providing Guidelines, Strategies, or Rules</title>
                <introduction>
                    <p>Perhaps the most common use of lists in the handbook is to give the reader consolidated instructions about <em>what</em> to do or <em>how</em> to do something (it is a writing handbook, after all). Often, you will want to also explain <em>why</em> to do something, so the list structure must be flexibile enough to accomodate both long explanations and brief pointers about what the reader should do. You may, in your journey of authorship of the handbook, discover that you want your particular set of instructions to look different, but <alert>readers benefit from consistency</alert>. If you think that instructions in general should be formatted differently, you should update how lists look <em>everywhere</em>, and you should update these instructions.</p>

                    <title>Strategies for Providing Strategies in <pubtitle>Sound Writing</pubtitle></title>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p><em>Use a <tag>list</tag> as the outermost container for your set of instructions.</em></p>
                            <p>This tag is known as a <q>named list</q>, and can be cross<ndash/>referenced, given titles, and used to store description lists, ordered lists, and unordered lists alike.

                            <p>This consistency alerts readers right away to what kind of content they are about ot read. The choice of the term <q>strategies</q> as opposed to <q>guidelines</q> or <q>rules</q> is intentional<mdash/><pubtitle>Sound Writing</pubtitle> is authored primarily by students and is meant to be informative and reliable without being authoritative. Its goal is to explain norms that really impact writing, for better and for worse, without putting them on a pedestal as a moral good. The term <q>strategies</q> achieves this end because it leaves the reader with the agency to decide whether they want to employ each strategy depending on whether they want to achieve the outcome it leads to or not.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><em>Use an unordered list (<tag>ul</tag>) unless the order of the steps matters.</em></p>
                            <p>Unfortunately, doing this makes it impossible to cross<ndash/>reference individual items from your list, so you will have to reference the entire list if you wish to remind readers of a strategy that is elsewhere in the handbook. Treat this as a productive constraint and keep the focus of your strategies narrow and specific.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><em>Make the first sentence of each list item an <em>imperative</em> instruction<mdash/>it must be something that readers can <em>DO</em>, not just a fact.</em></p>
                            <p>To mark this imperative as distinct from the explanation, you should wrap the instruction in both emphasis (<tag>em</tag>) and a paragraph block (<tag>p</tag>). Subsequent explanation that clarifies the instruction should be placed in a separate paragraph block so that there is a clear visual distinction between the imperative and the explanation.</p>

                <p>
                    Another way that lists are used frequently is to provide the reader with a list of questions to consider. We format this list as follows:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>The outermost block is an <tag>assemblage</tag> that contains a <tag>title</tag> and a <tag>p</tag> that holds an unordered list (<tag>ul</tag>).</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>The <tag>title</tag> of the assemblage should be <q>Helpful Questions for <fillin/></q> where the blank is filled in with a specific gerund phrase.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Each list item within this structure should be a <alert>question</alert> and since each item is a question the reader should ask themselves (and nothing else), you should not use quotatiopn marks around the questions.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Each question should be written in <em>first<ndash/>person</em>, as in <q>Is what I'm writing going to be helpful to future authors?</q> not <q>Is what you're writing helpful to future authors?</q></p>

            <title>Using Assemblages</title>
            <introduction>
                <p>
                    Because of how aesthetically pleasing they are in breaking up large blocks of text, it can be tempting to use an <tag>assemblage</tag> haphazardly to commit the <pretext/> sin of authoring with aesthetics, rather than structure, in mind.
                </p>
                <assemblage>
                    <title>Sample Assemblage</title>
                    <p>
                        Doesn't this look nice and important? I bet you didn't even read the first paragraph of this introduction because the blue box just pulled your focus into this 100% frivolous text.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Anyway, an assemblage can have (but does not require) a <tag>title</tag> and was designed to be a simple, amorphous container for other simple blocks like <tag>p</tag>. Don't go crazy nesting structures within assemblages. You <alert>cannot cross<ndash/>reference an assemblage</alert> since it is not a <q>numbered</q> block.
                    </p>
                </assemblage>
                <p>
                    Whenever possible, you should only use an assemblage when<ellipsis/>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>you want a fact that you're explaining in a <tag>p</tag> to stand out as especially important.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>you are <xref ref="general-principles-providing-questions"/> (wrap the entire unnamed list in a <tag>p</tag> in the assemblage body).</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>you are highlighting a quote from a student, staff, or faculty member (this is used extensively in <url href="https://soundwriting.pugetsound.edu/awareness-inclusive-language.html">Inclusive Language</url>).</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <note>
                    <title>Preventing Tag Abuse of Assemblage</title>

                        Based on these guidelines, it will be tempting to use an assemblage to call attention to a <q>note</q> or <q>tip</q> that you want the reader to keep in mind, but you should use the <tag>note</tag> and <tag>insight</tag> (displays as <q>tip</q>) in those cases!

            <title>Cross<ndash/>Referencing Schema</title>
            <introduction>
            <p>To take advantage of cross<ndash/>referencing, which <pretext/> and a digital platform make easy, you will need to provide an <term>xml id</term> to every element that you wish to be able to cross<ndash/>reference. The beauty of this system is that if you change where a piece of cross<ndash/>referenced content is located, all of the reference links still work because you haven't changed the <c>xml:id</c>. This means that if you <em>do</em> change the <c>xml:id</c>, your links <alert>will</alert> break. You can find more on <url href="https://pretextbook.org/doc/author-guide/html/topic-cross-referencing.html">cross<ndash/>referencing</url> in the <url href="https://pretextbook.org/doc/author-guide/html/index.html"><pretext/> Author's Guide </url>, so here we only address the schema we (try to) use in <pubtitle>Sound Writing</pubtitle>.</p>

        <subsection xml:id="ag-narrative-offset">
            <title>Narrative Offset Elements (Remark<ndash/>Like)</title>
            <introduction>
                <p>
                    One capability that you as an author should look to implement is the possibility for <pretext/> to intersperse the text with a handful of <q>remark<ndash/>like</q> elements that belong to the same <q>class.</q> All of these elements follow the same <q>programming rules,</q> so anything that you can do with one of the elements, you can do with any of them (and conversely anything that doesn't work in one won't work in any of the others either). Each element can be formatted differently, however, so you can easily call your reader's attention to the different kinds of content that you're sharing with them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are six <q>remark<ndash/>like</q> elements you can use: <tag>remark</tag>, <tag>convention</tag>, <tag>note</tag>, <tag>observation</tag>, <tag>warning</tag>, and <tag>insight</tag> (tip). So far, we have implemented <xref ref="element-formatting-note"/> and <xref ref="element-formatting-insight"/> and provided rules for using each of them. You are encouraged to find ways to incorporate more remark<ndash/>like elements into the handbook; however, <em>you must also identify a structural role that the element fills</em> and provide guidelines to future authors for how to use the element in a consistent way.

                <p>
                    A <tag>note</tag> captures text that doesn't flow with the narrative arc of the text you're writing but that you consider essential for readers to know. You do not need to give your note a <tag>title</tag><mdash/>it should just display the text <q>Note.</q> without any numbering.

                <p>
                    Because offering <q>tips</q> is common practice in all sorts of guides, we have renamed the <tag>insight</tag> tag to display as a <q>tip</q> instead. You should only call something a <q>tip</q> and use the <tag>insight</tag> tag when the advice you're giving the reader can truly be heeded or disregarded without impacting the reader's success. So <q>make a <init>CWLT</init> appointment for the week before your paper is due so you're accountable for starting it!</q> is an appropriate tip because it recommends an <em>optional method</em> for achieving a goal. <q>Start your paper early!</q> is <em>not</em> a good tip because following this advice is an expectation, not a <q>system hack.</q>

                    <p>Here's another hot tip for you (this time without a title): sprinkle the handbook with easily<ndash/>formatted REMARK-LIKE structures so that the writing handbook looks like the instructional equivalent of dessert and not a droll pile of boring additional reading!</p>

                <title>Warning</title>
                <warning>
                    As a rhetorical device, the <tag>warning</tag> tag/block/environment verges on too authoritarian for this handbook. Don't let the power go to your head; this handbook is still meant to be student<ndash/>authored and to give students agency with and control over language by laying bare the unerlying rules without acting all hign<ndash/>and<ndash/>mighty about it.
                </warning>
                <p>You are encouraged to use a <tag>warning</tag> to call the reader's attention to an <em>essential action</em>. Here's a heuristic for figuring out when to use a warning: While you might use an <tag>insight</tag> (tip) to <em>suggest a method</em> to a reader and a <tag>note</tag> to provide essential information that the reader needs to know to succeed, a <tag>warning</tag> is slightly stronger<mdash/>it is an action that the reader <em>must</em> take to succeed. It is especially effective to use the warning environment when you have just explained something to the reader that might lead them down a dangerous path. Say you're writing a section about how physics is about building up understanding of the world from a minimal set of first principles. Your reader might be pretty into that, and you wouldn't want them to get into trouble <ellipsis/></p>
                <warning>
                    <title>Elitism</title>
                    <p>Physics <em>does</em> value a perspective of building efficient models from <q>first principles,</q> but don't act like other disciplines are worthless or that you can <q>figure out</q> an entire academic discipline after taking an intro class just because you're a physics major. This attitude is incorrect, and it's especially socially costly to walk around Wyatt talking like that <ellipsis/>.</p>

                <title>Overall Structure</title>
                <p>Sections in this chapter are written in close collaboration with faculty members in the department that the section covers. Typically, the student handbook author interviews faculty members and then writes the contents of the section based on what faculty members say in those interviews. A completed draft is presented to the department for approval, and upon receiving approval, it is put into the handbook in its final version.</p>
                <p>Each section begins with a brief introduction about what makes writing in a particular discipline difficult and is followed by a <tag>note</tag> with the following text: <q>Unless otherwise stated, all quotes throughout this section are excerpted from the interview with <fillin/> faculty members that informed this section.</q> The remainder of the section is broken into <tag>paragraphs</tag> titled <q>Genres,</q> <q>Purpose,</q> <q>Traits and Characteristics,</q> <q>Evidence,</q> <q>Conventions and Tips,</q> and <q>Additional Resources.</q> When relevant, the first sentence after the <tag>title</tag> of each paragraph should be a quote by a faculty member excerpted from the informational interview that informed the section. This quote should be in quotation marks (<tag>q</tag>) <em>and</em> italicized with emphasis (<tag>em</tag>).</p>

        <title>POSSIBLE ADDITION: Writing Curriculum Vitae</title>
        <introduction>
            <aside>
                This section would be added to Chapter 11, <q>Genres</q> below <q>Writing Resumes.</q> It would need to be approved before being added.

            <title>What is a Curriculum Vitae?</title>
            <p>
                Writing a Curriculum Vitae (often abbreviated as <q><init>CV</init></q> or shortened to <q>vita</q>) has much in common with <url href="https://soundwriting.pugetsound.edu/section-resume.html">Writing Resumes</url>; however your <init>CV</init> serves a slightly different purpose than your resume. Resumes are more popular in non<ndash/>academic work and tend to prioritize your relevant skills and professional experience, and you are expected to tailor your resume to suit each individual job you apply for. The purpose of a <init>CV</init>, on the other hand, is to speak to your comprehensive qualification to be a member of an academic community. Broadly speaking, the three core aspects of an academic job are (1) creating new knowledge by undertaking research and sharing your results, (2) propagating existing knowledge by teaching students, and (3) serving on committees to run academic institutions and societies. At each stage of your career, your <init>CV</init> should speak to what you’ve done in each of these categories over the course of your life.

            <title>When to have a <init>CV</init></title>
            <p>
                If you’re interested in an academic job, you should start keeping track of your academic work when you begin your undergraduate education. You might not need to send anyone your <init>CV</init> until you apply for graduate school 4+ years later (or perhaps not even until you’re applying to jobs after you get a PhD), but since a <init>CV</init> is meant to be comprehensive and because you only need one, it’s easiest to build one as you progress through your life. If you’re not interested in academic jobs, it still might be useful to build a <init>CV</init> to serve as a <q>master resume</q> that you can pull content from each time you apply for a new opportunity.

            <title>The Contents of a <init>CV</init></title>
            <p>
                What you as an undergrad can put on your <init>CV</init> to apply for graduate school is vastly different from what a veteran professor can put on their <init>CV</init> to apply for an associate dean position, but in both cases the <init>CV</init> should be a comprehensive record of an individual’s scholarly work. Whereas writing a good resume requires that you know a lot about the position that you’re applying for, writing a good <init>CV</init> requires that you keep a good <q>paper trail</q> of your significant academic work, especially for things that you’ve done that fit into one of the three core aspects listed above. You’ll probably want to keep track of the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Your educational history as far back as your undergraduate college, including any awards you’ve won or honor societies you’re a part of</p>

                            Your research experience:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Descriptions of what you specifically did, much as you would list for a resume</li>
                                <li>List of all of your scholarly publications</li>
                                <li>List of any non<ndash/>peer<ndash/>reviewed writing you did. If you can link to a place where someone reading your <init>CV</init> could find something you wrote, you should include it!</li>

            <p>
                As far as the content of what appears on a <init>CV</init>, you may at first notice that you’re putting everything on your <init>CV</init>, and that’s okay. When you’re just starting out, part of the function of a <init>CV</init> is maintaining a record (build that paper trail!) of the path you’re taking. As you get older and progress through graduate school, fellowship experiences, post<ndash/>docs and professorships, you can remove the least<ndash/>relevant items from your <init>CV</init>, but it’s difficult to retroactively add many years of experience to a <init>CV</init> that you need down the road if you haven’t been keeping track of all of your experiences, awards, presentations, and more.

            <p>
                If you like to argue, we have good news for you: not only are there different <em>topics</em> to argue about and <em>positions</em> to take in arguments<mdash/>there are different styles, or <em>modes</em> that you can choose from to structure your argument! You may find that you prefer some modes over others, but you should treat modes of argumentation as tools in your toolbox; you wouldn’t say that some tools are <em>better</em> than other tools because each tool is suited for a different task. Additionally, recognizing the tools that other people are using in their arguments will help you understand and critique them, which is an important aspect of engaging with the scholarly community.

            <title>4.4 Introductions</title>
            <p>
                Writing an introduction is widely considered one of the most challenging steps in writing a paper. The challenge of writing a great introduction is real, but armed with a good understanding of introductions, a useful metaphor, and some concrete guidelines, the task of hooking your reader, laying out your argument, and asserting your thesis is one you can overcome.  In this section, you’ll learn <em>why</em> you need an introduction, <em>what</em> goes in an introduction, and <em>how</em> to construct an effective introduction (and yes, we got lost in the meta trying to write <em>this</em> introduction!).

            <title>4.5 Body Paragraphs</title>
            <p>
                If your introduction is your roadmap, the main body of your paper is the journey you’re taking your reader on. Like your grandparents, your reader doesn’t trust Google Maps, so you’re going to need to make sure that they don’t get lost trying to understand your argument. You can help your reader out in this endeavor by carefully considering how to organize your body paragraphs, what topic sentences best summarize the claims that support your thesis, and what transitions will cue your reader in on how your ideas are connected to one another. Continuing the road trip metaphor, topic sentences are like the compass readings that keep your reader oriented relative to their destination. Transitions are the signposts that alert the reader that there’s a hairpin turn ahead or that they’re crossing state lines, and, body paragraphs are the landmarks along the way that make the reader appreciate the journey toward understanding your thesis.

            <p>
                Introductions and conclusions are the bookends that hold your paper together, and like writing introductions, writing conclusions can produce the <q>I want to tear my hair out</q> sensation that college students know (and love?). While introductions need to convince your reader to take the journey that is reading your paper and give them a good idea of what they’ll learn if they do so, conclusions need to give your reader a sense of closure after they finish their journey. In this section, you’ll learn why you need a conclusion,  what to put in your conclusion, and how to go about writing a conclusion that will give your reader the <q>looking<ndash/>back<ndash/>fondly<ndash/>on<ndash/>a<ndash/>great<ndash/>trip</q> feeling that a photo album can create.

                This section is a thorough rebuttal of the childhood idiom <q>sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me.</q> Here you can learn how words are connected to existing and previous power structures within and beyond academia and why it is important to consider your choice of language, especially as you write about individuals’ complex, intersectional identities and the relationships those identities have to the many different systems and personal interactions that comprise society. As you will read many times over again, this section is an introduction to the ever<ndash/>changing task of writing respectfully and knowledgeably about identity, not the be<ndash/>all and end<ndash/>all of writing with awareness.

            <p>
                Having covered some of the fundamental principles of grammar in the previous section, it’s time to level up! There are lots of English grammar topics that are tricky enough to merit a position in this section; however, the ones that you’ll learn about here made the cut because they’re not just tricky<mdash/>they’re commonly relevant. Building on the fundamental rules of grammar from the previous section, you’ll get another layer of nuance in this section, which covers some of the challenges of ensuring subject<ndash/>verb agreement, avoiding sentence fragments, using parallelism, and placing modifiers.

            <p>
                Having noticed that a great number of professors wax loquacious when giving lectures, you may be perplexed to learn that academics actually value brevity in academic writing. Professors face some of the same challenges that you probably face in college: they have a lot of reading to do, what they’re reading is specific and hard to understand, and they have to write about it themselves. From this predicament emerges the importance of writing precisely and clearly, choosing words carefully, being wary of passive voice, and packing meaning into a sentence by using colorful, strong verbs. In this section, you will learn to make intentional decisions about your writing style and word choice to enrich your essays.

                How to punctuate a sentence and when to capitalize a word are especially challenging decisions to make because of the vast number of rules and exceptions to rules that govern when to capitalization and punctuation, not to mention the fact that there are some rules that are contested (ever heard of an Oxford comma?). In this section, you won’t find <em>every</em> rule concerning capitalization and punctuation, but if you learn the rules here (which are all frequently<ndash/>relevant), you will be prepared to answer the majority of questions that you will have while writing.
