        <p><booktitle>Sound Writing</booktitle> has been a community effort, developed over the course of many years. Julie Neff-Lippman<mdash/>director of the Center for Writing, Learning, and Teaching from 1984 until 2011<mdash/>laid the groundwork for this handbook, exploring the possibility of a Puget Sound writing handbook, working with writing advisors to develop many of the handouts still in use in the <init>CWLT</init>, and developing the culture of peer leadership in the <init>CWLT</init> that makes a project like this possible. Julie Nelson Christoph<mdash/>director of the <init>CWLT</init> since 2012<mdash/>has further developed the project, leading a pilot of some commercial handbooks, one of which was chosen and customized as the first Puget Sound writing handbook, in use from 2012<ndash/>2017.</p>
        <p>In 2015, conversations on campus about linguistic diversity, about the special role of writing in a liberal arts context, and about the benefits of online and freely accessible books made us wonder: Could Puget Sound develop its own writing handbook? And if we could, who would write it? How long would it take to write? What would the platform look like?</p>
        <p>Student Writing Advisors Kylie Young ('17, <init>STS</init> and <acro>SOAN</acro> major), Kieran O'Neil ('16, Biology major), and Cody Chun ('17, English major) took a chance in spring 2016 and applied for the somewhat nebulous job of being <q>Writing Handbook Developers.</q> They faced an impossible task: collaboratively writing a handbook suitable for use in university writing courses <ellipsis/> in three months' time.</p>
        <p>This handbook originated in conversations among the four authors<mdash/>over coffee in Seattle; about articles we read and scholarly lectures we attended on language and learning; in the comfy chairs in the Center for Writing, Learning, and Teaching; over weekly transatlantic and transpacific Skype calls when our team was physically separated; and, always, through our abiding faith in the worth and importance of our project. Cody, Kieran, and Kylie composed the words you are about to read, using Julie as a sounding board, advisor, and editor through the process. The writers are grateful to Julie for her mentorship, her trust in us and our abilities, and her ever-inspiring guidance and gusto.</p>
        <p>As with any group project, part of the work has been identifying individual talents and coordinating efforts. We've been extremely fortunate in having a diverse range of interests and disciplinary backgrounds represented on the team. We've all learned a great deal about writing and collaboration from each other, and the team as a whole has coordinated efforts so that the project has progressed continuously, sometimes with the full team, sometimes with individual members stepping up and doing more when others were unable to do so. The collaborative process and support has been truly remarkable.</p>
        <p>Many, many thanks go to Associate Dean Martin Jackson for supporting the project in countless ways from the very earliest moment; this has been a huge project to undertake, and your willingness to entertain the possibility, to find the funding, to bounce ideas, and even to pinch-hit as a programmer have been invaluable.</p>
        <p>Isabelle Anderson ('18, Chemistry and English major) is the first annual writing handbook developer who has, with excitement, humor, and diligence, taken on the (still nebulous) task of keeping the handbook up to date. We, the initial writers, are grateful for your willingness to improve the book that has come to mean so much to us. In 2017, she met with departments at Puget Sound to listen to faculty and develop the disciplinary writing guidelines that appear here.</p>
        <p>Special thanks go to Rob Beezer for developing the fabulous <pretext/> (n√©e MathBook XML) format and making it available to us and for taking a chance on a non-math project. Thanks also to Jahrme Risner ('18, Math and Computer Science major) for inputting all those GoogleDocs into the <pretext/> format, fielding feedback in multiple platforms and from multiple people with aplomb. We appreciate your work to make information freely available and accessible to all. We are grateful to Sarah Stall and Julie Reynolds for helping us consider design options for the handbook and, especially, for Sarah's intensive work proofreading a near-final draft.</p>
        <p>We would also like to thank Geoffrey Block, Bill Breitenbach, Gwynne Brown, Kris Imbrigotta, Chris Kendall, Kriszta Kotsis, and Amy Spivey for making the time to be interviewed about writing, writing process, and advice to student writers. Thank you, as well, to Fallon Boyle, Bill Breitenbach, Nancy Bristow, Bev Conner, George Erving, Will Gent, Dexter Gordon, Pierre Ly, Julie Neff-Lippman, Helen Shears, Ariela Tubert, and Kara Widergren for their assistance with the example student papers and writing prompts. As always, thank you to Peggy Burge, Jane Carlin, and everyone at Collins Memorial Library for your collaboration. And thank you to the many Puget Sound students and faculty who have responded to surveys and participated in focus groups and discussions that have shaped this book.</p>
        <p>Perhaps our greatest thanks are to you, our users! Thank you for using the Puget Sound writing handbook. We hope you will enjoy using it and that it will inspire you<mdash/>as it has us<mdash/>to think critically about language, to talk with each other about writing, and to engage in the communal effort that is at the heart of scholarship. <booktitle>Sound Writing</booktitle> is a living document and will continue to be revised online; please collaborate by sending your comments and suggestions to <url href="mailto:soundwriting@pugetsound.edu">soundwriting@pugetsound.edu</url>.</p>

        <title>Preface</title>
        <p>Whether you are reading this for class or browsing<mdash/>whether you are working on an essay for your SSI or drafting your comparative politics thesis<mdash/>whether you love writing or consider it a chore<mdash/><booktitle>Sound Writing</booktitle> is for you.</p>
        <p>The purpose of <booktitle>Sound Writing</booktitle> is to equip you with the techniques that you will need to succeed as an academic writer. As you'll soon discover (if you have not discovered already), academic writing is diverse and reflects writers' own personal, disciplinary, and sub disciplinary biases. (Take a look at the example essays <url href="https://www.pugetsound.edu/academics/academic-resources/cwlt/student-writing-and-learning-resources/example-student-papers-with-comments">here</url>.) That said, academic writing in any discipline can nonetheless be defined by the common emphasis on clear and specific theses, the situation of arguments in their proper scholarly contexts, the explicit elaboration on the significance of research, and the rigorous use of evidence to substantiate claims. These traits distinguish academic writing from other types of writing, such as popular writing (the type of writing that one finds on blogs, in newspapers and magazines, and on Facebook). Academic writing is a practice with its own conventions and expectations. In <booktitle>Sound Writing</booktitle>, we hope to provide you with the essentials of university writing so that you can write with as little stress and as much success as possible. Inside this book, you'll find a breakdown of research, composition, and revision processes; strategies for overcoming common writing challenges; advice from faculty members; a guide to <init>APA</init>-, Chicago-, and <init>MLA</init>-style citations; and much more.</p>
        <p>Our work is guided by the belief that language evolves and reflects, in its evolution, both socio political change and cultural particularity. That is, language reflects history. We therefore work against the notion of a <q><xref ref="SAE" text="title"/></q> (hereafter <init>SAE</init>). <init>SAE</init> describes the set of historically and culturally venerated rules that regulate English grammar, syntax, pronunciation, and spelling. Of course, the notion that <init>SAE</init> is <q>standard</q> is contested: On the one hand, the lack of consistent interregional usage confutes the claim that <init>SAE</init> is standard; on the other, <init>SAE</init> is not truly <q>American</q> and has often been used to normalize white, middle- and upper-class language patterns and to denigrate language patterns that differ from them (hence, becoming <q>non standard</q> and <q>improper</q>). The notion of a <q><xref ref="SAE" text="title"/>,</q> then, is problematic in its reinforcement of discourses of otherness. Despite its problematic nature, <init>SAE</init> also has a privileged status in the academy. We recognize this fact at the same time that we work against its implications.</p>
        <p>We also acknowledge that English can marginalize, traumatize, and oppress, and we suggest alternatives to sexist, LGBTQ+-phobic, racist, classist, and ableist terminologies of oppression. We hope to challenge the parochial assumptions of these usages and to encourage you to write with respect and awareness in both your academic and social discourse. The autonomy of the informed writer is important to us, and we hope to enable readers to be intentional writers.</p>
        <p>Our goal is to promote the socially conscious and <q>sound writing</q> aspired to by a Puget Sound education. As writing advisors at the Center for Writing, Learning, and Teaching, and as students who have faced challenges similar to those that you will face, we have tailored this book to the needs of Puget Sound students. We hope the free, online platform will make it accessible to all.</p>

        <title>Overview</title>
        <p>In order to make this <em>Sound Writing</em> handbook as easy to use and as accessible as possible, we've broken it into twelve chapters, each one focusing on a different aspect of the research and writing process. Clicking on a chapter title in the Table of Contents will take you to that chapter, which means you no longer need to flip through pages to find what you're looking for!</p>
        <p><xref ref="research-methods"/> and <xref ref="how-to-read"/> suggest techniques for researching, reading source material, and taking notes. This is a good place to start if you have an assignment prompt and want some advice on finding, reading, or analyzing sources.</p>
        <p><xref ref="forming-your-argument"/> breaks down the basic parts of the argument, helps you to identify which argumentation style(s) to use, offers tips for making a strong argument, and covers how to develop, organize, and support your thesis.</p>
        <p><xref ref="the-writing-process"/> offers brainstorming techniques, planning strategies, and outlining formats to get your scholarly gears turning. It also breaks down the skeleton of the paper, offering tips on how to compose and organize introductions, topic sentences, body paragraphs, and conclusions. Writing is not a linear process, so you'll likely still be conducting research and changing your argument as you go; to maintain your groove, refer to the sections on revising and adding new research. And if you find that you just can't write any longer, take a look at the section on overcoming writer's block and other obstacles for ideas on how to overcome anxiety and frustration, manage your time, and procrastinate (yes, procrastinate!) productively.</p>
        <p>In <xref ref="discipline-specific-writing"/>, we compile guidelines from faculty members across campus to help you navigate within and between the different disciplines you will encounter over the course of your Puget Sound education, as you fulfill your core requirements and generally become a more well-rounded, inquisitive, boundary-crossing liberal arts version of yourself.</p>
        <p><xref ref="writing-with-awareness"/> suggests ways to write with greater sensitivity to the social ramifications of certain English usages. We include a list of terminologies of oppression for the respectful writer to avoid and a list of possible alternatives.</p>
        <p><xref ref="writing-sentence-level"/> and <xref ref="citations"/> focus on the nitty-gritty, but necessary, elements of language, offering grammatical and mechanical advice and examples of how to cite your sources in keeping with the APA, Chicago, and MLA styles.</p>
        <p><xref ref="speaking"/> considers the relationship between writing and speaking, and offers advice on how to convert your written argument into an oral argument. This chapter also includes suggestions for effective public speaking, for organizing your presentation, and for managing your time.</p>
        <p><xref ref="good-to-know"/> offers Snapple-cap-esque facts about different languages and linguistic modes, differences between written and spoken language, and tips for dealing with the murkier aspects of <xref ref="SAE" text="title"/>, among other things.</p>
        <p><xref provisional="The New Chapter"/> also suggests on- and off-campus study spots, teaches you how to procrastinate productively, and provides some fun facts about Puget Sound.</p>
        <p><xref ref="different-writing-genres"/> extends beyond academic writing to offer advice on writing tricky non academic genres like emails to professors and employers, personal statements, and resumes and cover letters. Those non academic genres are mostly short, but they're every bit as challenging to write well as a long research paper is. Don't worry; we've got your back.</p>
        <p>In <xref ref="resources"/>, you'll find a variety of example papers written by past Puget Sound students. These papers aren't perfect papers (what paper is?), and they include commentary explaining effective strategies and techniques for analytical writing. You can use these as guides for helping you organize and approach your own assignments; however, keep in mind that they should not be replicated or used as a template for your own writing, as each of your assignments will require its own style, organization, argument, and voice.</p>
