    <title>Discipline-Specific Writing</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>In the previous chapters, we have discussed general traits of all (or most?) academic writing and all academic writing processes. But, as you will no doubt notice, there are some significant differences between writing in different disciplines. It may sometimes seem like faculty members just want you to keep changing your writing to fit their individual preferences. While we all have our own preferences, faculty members also are trained specialists within their own disciplinary backgrounds, and part of their job is to teach you about those disciplinary backgrounds<mdash/>including the writing conventions of those disciplines.</p>
        <p>To help you navigate the discipline-specific writing conventions you encounter in your courses, we have consulted with faculty in departments at Puget Sound. Based on our conversations with them, we have compiled the following guidelines. Try using these guidelines when you write your next paper; you may find that that seemingly quirky assignment makes more sense than you initially thought!</p>

        <title>Writing for Art and Art History</title>
        <p>Writing about art can be challenging because, before embarking on a discussion or analysis of a work, you first have to translate your experience of a visual image or a structure into language.  This is true not only for Art History students whose papers are often based on the visual analysis of images or monuments, but also for Studio Art students who write artist statements in which they verbally articulate ideas and influences that they have expressed visually in their work.</p>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Genres</title>
            <p>The most frequent types of papers students write in Art History courses include visual analysis papers, research papers, critical analyses of scholarly articles, and exhibition reviews.  While research papers and critical analyses of scholarly articles are similar to such papers in other disciplines (<eg/>, History or English), they likely include a visual analysis component that is not typical in other disciplines.  Visual analysis papers and exhibition reviews are genres unique to Art History and Art Criticism, and they both build on the close reading of a single object/monument or a close reading of a series objects and the space in which they are displayed.  Studio Art students frequently write exhibition reviews or responses, analyses of the work of an influential artist, and artist statements.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Purpose</title>
            <p>The purpose of writing in Art and Art History courses is to derive meaning from visual works from the past and present, to become more skilled in visual literacy, and to develop and amplify skills of analysis and argumentation, and independent thinking.  Art and Art History papers will also develop your self-expression and facilitate your immersion in the creative field of Art or the scholarly field of Art History based upon sound research skills and careful, solid arguments.  Studio Art courses will prompt you to reflect carefully on your own artistic processes and ways of thinking and to articulate your relationship to the tradition of art-making.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Valued Characteristics</title>
            <p>A unique characteristic of writing in Art History is its reliance on visual analysis. The ultimate goal of writing a visual analysis is to understand how the work you're writing about conveyed and conveys meaning.  A convincing visual analysis is an interpretation of the work that combines the examination of formal, experiential details in light of relevant contextual information, therefore close reading of visual information and the critical analysis of primary and secondary sources are valued characteristics of art historical writing.</p>
            <p>For visual analysis papers and exhibition reviews, the first step is translating your experience of what you see and what you feel or perceive with your senses into words; for example, when you stand in front of Michelangelo's <pubtitle>David</pubtitle> at the Gallery of the Academy in Florence, you not only look at the composition and carefully crafted details of the sculpture, you also react to its size, its placement on a high pedestal, your opportunity to walk around the figure, and the space where it is displayed and other visitors' reactions to it. When you are not able to visit the work in person, you should still try to imagine how it operates in its physical context, taking into account whether it is currently found in its original location.  Once you have performed this first, observational step, the second step in visual analysis is to contextualize the artwork you're writing about in its historical moment.  One way to contextualize an artwork is to compare it to works of art that have a similar subject matter, share its time period, or both. This kind of comparison will help you and your reader understand how the work fits into larger artistic developments. Another way to contextualize an artwork is to understand its social, religious, or cultural role by using primary textual sources (<eg/>, diaries of artists or patrons involved, documents of the work's commissioning, preparatory sketches or studies of the artist, newspaper articles that reveal how the work was received when it was first displayed, and historical accounts that describe the work). A third way to contextualize an artwork is to understand how it was originally displayed. A final contextualization strategy is to use the work of scholars who have studied the same monument or related monument to build on or refute.</p>
            <p>A common genre in Studio Art is an artist statement. The valued characteristics in an artist statement differ somewhat from those in a visual analysis. An artist statement is a short essay, about one page in length that is written in the first person. The purpose of artist statements is to articulate the processes, influences, and concepts that inform your independent artistic practices. These statements verbalize the multi-faceted ideas that inform artists' work, providing helpful context for viewers, curators, selection panels, and peers.  A compelling artist statement communicates significant elements about the motives and concerns that inspire works of art.  It can address a number of meaningful issues and influences such as your sense of identity, intellectual or technical aspects of your artistic process, and your position in relation to the history of your medium.  An artist statement is subjective in the sense that it reflects personal creative processes, yet it should also reflect and even interrogate broader cultural, social, political, and/or scientific themes.</p>

        <paragraphs>
            <title>Evidence</title>
            <p>For Art History papers, your evidence will be drawn from three types of sources: the visual evidence provided by the work of art that you are analyzing; primary textual sources that date to the same period as your visual evidence; and scholarly secondary sources.  Secondary scholarly sources can provide you with a framework for analysis, or can provide factual information about primary sources that the author used but you may not have easy access to. Secondary sources can also offer an interpretation of the work you are analyzing which you may accept or reject based on your own critical analysis of the work, primary sources, and the scholarly literature. You will need to document the sources of your ideas and information vigorously throughout your paper in order to show what sources you have used for your work; art historians typically use footnotes or endnotes for such purpose.</p>
            <p>Papers that you will write in Studio Art courses will focus primarily on visual evidence, although occasionally primary sources of artists' writings or secondary scholarly sources will also be used.</p>

                <li>
                    <title>Be selective.</title>
                    <p>When you are writing a visual analysis, keep in mind that you will not be able to describe every detail of the work, so you will need to select the most dominant features that convey the meaning of the work. In organizing a visual analysis, always provide a brief description of the work as a whole before examining specific details of it more fully.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <title>Be descriptive and analytical.</title>
                    <p>When you describe visual features of an artwork in your visual analysis, explain why those aspects of the work contribute to the overall meaning conveyed by the work. Describing a visual feature of an artwork is similar to using quotes in other disciplines, such as History or English.  Just as you do not throw a quote from a primary or secondary source into your text without explaining its importance, do not let the visual evidence speak for itself, since a different viewer might draw different conclusions than what you are getting at.</p>

        <title>Writing for Biology</title>
        <p>Some students initially believe that writing is not important to science; however, lab reports are actually vital to understanding the context and the relevance of the science you are doing in lab and learning about in class, and their format allows scientists to communicate findings concisely and succinctly. After learning the specific skills that are needed, many students learn that they particularly enjoy writing for the natural sciences. Read this guide to learn about how writing for biology can be helpful and meaningful to you!</p>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Genres</title>
            <p>As in most science classes, the vast majority of the writing you do will be in the form of lab reports. Lab reports are papers based on an investigation that follows the standard template of an introduction, a methods section, a presentation of results, and a discussion of those results. In most biology classes you will be asked to write both full-length lab reports as well as individual sections of one for practice. Other kinds of writing that you may be asked to do include abstracts, critical reviews (in which you synthesize the primary literature on a topic) or, in upper-division classes, research proposals, and research papers.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Purpose</title>
            <p><q><em>We spend so much time in lab on the methods portion and results portion, but lab reports are really helpful because they make us put our results in the greater context.</em></q></p>
            <p>It's entirely too easy to become myopic in lab (both figuratively and literally<mdash/>goggles don't help anyone's eyesight). Because of this possibility, lab reports become not only effective ways to communicate the results of an experiment to other scientists, but also good places to help you understand the science you have done more fully and in the context of biology as a discipline. Further, while the prescribed format may seem constraining, there is a reason why it has lasted: it can help you organize your own thoughts and give you the space to <q>step back</q> and find the larger frame for your experiment. In this way, lab reports are actually great opportunities to rethink what you've done in lab and learned in class on your own and to understand the larger import of the experiment you conducted.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Traits and Characteristics</title>
            <p><q><em>I like to think of science almost like a coral reef you can build on: you build on what's beneath.</em></q></p>
            <p>The purpose of doing an experiment is never just to have done the experiment; rather, as the quote marking this subsection indicates, the purpose of a lab is not to repeat something already known but to build innovatively on what you've learned, allowing you to explore the emergent properties of scientific knowledge. This idea is particularly important to remember when you're writing for biology because writing in biology requires that you frame any experimental description with the <q>why</q> behind your research.</p>
            <p>Further, because biology is a natural science, it adheres to the principles of the scientific method, requiring objectivity, reproducibility, and quantitative results. For these reasons it's important to communicate clearly and efficiently in a style that reflects this objectivity and relies on quantitative values rather than vague words like <q>more</q> or <q>greater.</q></p>
            <p>While there is a convention-driven style to a lot of science writing in which you follow established norms, a good scientist thinks creatively about the field, where the gaps are, and where they can contribute. In this way, there is always room within the individual sections and their connecting links to explain ideas in an innovative way, ask creative questions, and propose new ideas for future research.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Evidence</title>
            <p>Because biology is a natural science, the only kind of data you should use is empirical, reproducible data you have collected yourself or data from a peer-reviewed, secondary source published in a scholarly journal. Quoting is generally discouraged, although there are exceptions for research papers, proposals, or grants.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><p>Don't write your paper in the order it's presented to you in the template. It's easier to reverse-engineer your paper by starting with figures, tables, and the methods and results sections, and then working your way through the discussion, finishing with your title and introduction. This approach will allow you to focus the information that you include in your introduction so that it is relevant to the rest of the experiment rather than wasting time writing about things that aren't relevant.</p></li>
                <li><p>Rely on the formatting given to you by your professors. Specifically ask your professor about whether they prefer active or passive voice<mdash/>this issue is still up for debate in science writing, and different professors (and different branches of the field) have different policies.</p></li>

        <title>Writing for Business</title>
        <p>Business is a social science, making it part of a distinct group of disciplines that use scientific methods to study individual and social behavior. Among these disciplines, business is uniquely oriented toward the professional world outside of purely academic domains. Its professional focus can be unfamiliar and can sometimes disconcert new writers. Read through these guidelines to get a better idea of how to write for business.</p>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Genres</title>
            <p>The typical genres you'll be writing in for business are short memos<mdash/>in which you will brief your audience with the relevant and pressing facts of a situation<mdash/>and case studies, which consist of three parts: an introduction, in which you will provide appropriate historical and contextual information about a business or company; a strategic analysis section, in which you will identify and analyze structural and organizational problems with that business or company; and a final section, in which you will recommend solutions for those problems. Other typical genres include position papers, in which you will present a disputable issue from one side; research papers, for which you will research a topic and present that research to support a thesis; literature reviews, in which you will summarize and analyze secondary sources relevant to a specific topic; and personal reflections.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Purpose</title>
            <p><q><em>Writing is used in decision-making.</em></q></p>
            <p>The purpose of writing for business classes isn't exactly the same as the purpose of writing in the professional business world: classes are specifically designed for you to practice and improve your writing skills, whereas the professional world is often more results oriented. For this reason, academic papers are generally more focused and less broad than professional ones so that you will have enough time to do a thorough job. Despite the difference between class and the professional world, you should treat the business essays you write as though they were directed at a real professional audience. Accordingly, because your imagined audience is made up of practicing professionals, it's important to remember that, whereas in most other disciplines you are only trying to persuade someone to <em>believe</em> something, in business you are trying to persuade someone to believe something <em>so that they will do something</em>. You can think of your writing as a tool you can use to have a direct impact on a person's, company's, or government's actions.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Valued Characteristics</title>
            <p><q><em>Don't make your reader do the work. You need to do all the work.</em></q></p>
            <p>Writing for business should be as direct, simple, concise, and accurate as possible<mdash/>don't use too many adjectives or try to sound poetic. Although this spare style of writing may feel impersonal, there are very important reasons to use it. The writing done for business in the professional world is used directly in decision-making. In consequence, the conventions of business writing are oriented toward informing your readers so that they can make their decisions as accurately and efficiently as possible. By being direct and simple, you allow your audience to understand the situation and ideas you are describing while simultaneously making it clear to that audience that you understand the situation and are a competent source. By being concise, you show that you are efficient and that you value your readers' time, and by being accurate you show your reader that you are willing to be honest and realistic.</p>
            <p>Further, within these guidelines there is room to be creative: an important part of business writing is innovation. In the last part of many business papers (such as case studies) you will be asked to suggest possible solutions to the problem or question you've outlined in the body of your paper. This is a place in your writing where you get to think innovatively about the possible futures and outcomes of various choices, and present your ideas about how best to implement strategies to ensure the best possible future. In this part of your writing it's particularly important to be value neutral: these possible solutions are not about what a person <em>should</em> do; these possible solutions are about what a person or company <em>can</em> do.</p>

        <paragraphs>
            <title>Evidence</title>
            <p>When you're providing evidence in a business paper, the kinds of evidence you'll want to rely on will come largely from peer-reviewed publications. In business scenarios, quantifiable evidence is usually the most persuasive, so using figures and situating data in its dated time period are key to building a reliable, accurate argument.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><p>Proofread your paper for spelling and grammar. While grammar may seem less important to some writers, imagine that you are a business executive sending an email to your staff. If the email you send has spelling errors in the first sentence you could lose credibility and professionalism in the eyes of your readers.</p></li>
                <li><p>You can use subheadings to organize your papers. While subheadings are discouraged in some disciplines, feel free to use them for business papers to add extra clarity and formality.</p></li>
                <li><p>Don't use clichés, contractions, or passive clauses. And while personal pronouns are okay, don't start a sentence with <q>I think.</q> While these rules may seem overly fastidious, it's important to follow them so that your writing is both professional and reflective of your own distinctive voice. Using clichés is counterproductive to both of these values because they aren't your own words and they are not particularly professional. Further, starting a sentence with <q>I think</q> can sound demure rather than convincing. And finally, using passive clauses rather than active ones can sometimes emphasize the responsibility or actions of the subject of a sentence. Write actively to ensure that your prose is fluid and compelling.</p></li>

        <title>Writing for Chemistry</title>
        <p>Writing can sometimes seem like an obstacle for science students. Within scientific culture, the importance of effective communication is often underemphasized. This under emphasis leads many students entering college to see science writing as, at best, a necessary evil, and at worst, a tangled mess of jargon and arbitrary formatting. So far from being true, the exact opposite is the case. In the wise words of Professor Steven Neshyba, <q>Science is in the communication. Science doesn't exist in someone's head.

            <title>Genres</title>
            <p>Writing in chemistry is challenging for new students since there are many different types of writing in chemistry. However, most of these genres can be broken down into a shared set of sections, each with its own distinctive style and purpose: a title, an abstract, an introduction, an experimental section, a results section, a discussion, a conclusion, and a literature cited. Together, these sections make up the most fundamental genre in chemistry writing: research articles (<ie/>, lab reports). Further, these sections also make up the research posters, review articles, and research proposals you'll be introduced to in upper-level classes. The only kind of writing in chemistry not made up by these sections is the notes you'll take in your laboratory notebook.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Purpose</title>
            <p>The purpose of chemistry writing depends on the genre. A lab notebook is meant to be fairly informal, but clear and detailed enough that another chemist unfamiliar with the experiment you're doing could open up your notebook and repeat the experiment. Keeping this kind of detailed record of your lab work will allow you to go back later and understand what it was you did in lab. In turn, understanding what you did will give you the context you need to write an informed lab report and thus make the process much easier.</p>
            <p>These lab reports are formal papers that are meant to be places for you to practice sorting through, presenting and analyzing data. Further, lab reports also give you practice deepening your understanding of what you did in lab by allowing you to see your knowledge gaps and fill them by looking things up or asking your classmates and professor. Last but not least, lab reports are the avenues of communicating your results to faculty and other scientists, making them the crucial places where science really occurs.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Valued Characteristics</title>
            <p><q><em>Brevity may be the soul of wit, but it is the cerebrum of good science writing.</em></q></p>
            <p>When you write for chemistry, be clear, concise, and precise. In art, ambiguity is often ripe with meaning, but in scientific writing ambiguity is distracting. One of the most common writing errors chemistry students make is being vague when they should be precise. Don't say <q>the product was obtained in good yield</q> when you could just as easily say <q>the aldehyde 3 was obtained in 64<percent/> yield,</q> a statement that contains much more useful information for other scientists trying to replicate your experiment.</p>
            <p>Despite the importance of clarity, being precise shouldn't prevent you from telling a story with your data: structuring a lab report as a narrative is a higher-level skill that can turn a seemingly mundane paper into a compelling one. Your Title provides a hook to draw in the reader; then the Introduction sets the narrative background and poses the problem that needs solving; the Experimental and Results sections show how your protagonist has interrogated nature, and the answers they have gained; and then the Discussion puts the results in context with other results cited in the Intro (by either verifying or contesting them) while forcing you to explain why this might be. Of course there are often questions left unanswered, or new questions that arose in the course of the work; these then appear at the end of the Discussion to entice the reader to look for the sequel (that is, the reader's own subsequent research).</p>

        <paragraphs>
            <title>Evidence</title>
            <p><q><em>A figure saves a thousand words.</em></q></p>
            <p>Evidence in chemistry<mdash/>as in all natural sciences<mdash/>is exclusively empirical, reproducible data from experiments you have done yourself or from a peer-reviewed, scholarly source. As the quote marking this subsection suggests, it can be very helpful to organize your results and explain the context you give in your introduction using figures and tables. These tables and figures are a powerful way to harness your evidence if you pair them with descriptive captions and embed them in the text of your lab report. That said, figures and tables don't <em>replace</em> words: don't include a figure if you don't explain it in text!</p>

             <paragraphs><title>Conventions and Tips</title>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Don't write from beginning to end. Many students think they should write a report in the order that it appears, but this is often an inefficient way to write a research paper<mdash/>the abstract comes immediately after the title, but it should normally be written last, because it is easier to summarize the research after you've written the entire report and have thus refined your understanding of the research. Although there is no one-size-fits-all approach, here is an order that is usually effective: Organize your thoughts and your data, write the Experimental Section, prepare the important illustrations (<ie/>, Tables, Figures, and Schemes), write the Results section (using the illustrations as a guide), draft an outline of the Discussion section, write the Introduction, complete the Discussion Section, write the Conclusions, add References, write the Title and Abstract.</p></li>
                <li><p>Start early and get help if needed. Usually professors won't have time to go over your whole draft, so make sure you go into office hours or send an email with a few specific questions for them to answer.</p></li>
                <li><p>Know your audience. You are writing for other chemists with a similar level of knowledge to your own but who are not familiar with the exact experiments you performed. You don't have to go into gory detail about procedures that any chemist should know<mdash/>it is even OK to use a little jargon if it is part of the chemist's lexicon. For example, <q>the reaction was heated at reflux for 2 hours</q> is perfectly clear to any chemist who has taken organic chemistry.</p></li>
                <li><p>Delete superfluous words: don't say <q>the melting point <em>was determined to be</em> 198<ndash/>199ºC,</q> say <q>the melting point <em>is</em> 198<ndash/>199ºC.</q></p></li>
                <li><p>Chemical names are not capitalized (unless they are trade names).</p></li>
                <li><p>All manuscripts should be double-spaced (unless told otherwise).</p></li>
                <li><p>Use the proper number of significant figures when reporting data.</p></li>

        <title>Writing for English</title>
        <p>Many students entering college think they know what writing for an English class should be like: While most students haven't taken a psychology or Science, Technology, and Society class, the majority of students have taken several English classes before college and have prior experience writing English papers. Depending on their experiences, students may believe that English writing is congenitally imprecise and emotional because it is founded on subjective opinions rather than facts because <q>there are no right answers.</q> Alternately, students may think that English papers are brittle five-paragraph essays that impoverish the texts that they analyze. While these assumptions can be hard to displace, English essays are neither unsubstantiated opinions nor life-sucking exercises in pedantry. Rather, English essays can be powerful transformations of your impressions and emotions of a text into a substantiated analysis that reveals the more profound underpinnings of that text. Read this guide to get an idea of how to get the most out of writing for English!</p>

            <title>Genres</title>
            <p><q><em>Close reading is the meat and potatoes<mdash/>or the tofu and seitan<mdash/>of what we do.</em></q></p>
            <p>Although you'll be asked to write in scads of different genres for your English classes, close readings are the foundation on which all English writing rests. Close readings are essentially papers that ask you to move beyond saying <em>that</em> something exists in a text (for instance, alliteration), to <em>how</em> it's used: That is, what it suggests in relation to other elements of the text, and why that realization matters. Longer papers in English classes can take the form of open-ended research papers, or analysis of the relationships between a text and its historical moment; however, these longer papers are built upon extended close readings for which you will have developed a theoretical framework. Other genres in English include many kinds of creative writing, such as personal essays, memoirs, and poetry, as well as book reviews or letters. You may be asked to write in these creative genres in traditional English classes as well as creative writing English classes.</p>

            <title>Purpose</title>
            <p><q><em>We are not teaching, for the most part, content, as much as we're teaching habits of mind and skills. <ellipsis/> We are asking students to become practitioners of the genres and the forms that we ourselves work in.</em></q></p>
            <p>The purpose of writing in English classes is to become a better writer and a better reader. In your English classes your professors don't want you to put on an analytic production just for the professor's eyes; rather, you are being asked to take a step in a larger series of conversations that will allow you to practice habits of mind and transferable analytical skills. Hopefully these habits of mind will include a deeper appreciation for the profound and subtle ways language shapes our imagined realities, as well as how our own theoretical biases affect how we read a text.</p>

            <title>Valued Characteristics</title>
            <p><q><em>Show me that I'm progressing. <ellipsis/> I want to feel like I'm learning with the paper.</em></q></p>
            <p>Writing for English, perhaps more so than any other discipline, emphasizes the process or craft of an essay rather than the product. This emphasis is inherent to the discipline because English is so consummately qualitative: you are not presenting quantitative data or known observations and conclusions. Rather you are making a qualitative analysis that puts your data (your textual observations) into a meaningful pattern and then commenting on the overall meaning or effect of that pattern. In this way, the form of an English essay is just as important as its content: <em>how</em> you have organized your ideas and presented them is just as important as the ideas themselves. For this reason English papers should not be like lists of evidence; rather, they should show the development of an argument over the course of an essay, with each paragraph advancing the argument.</p>
            <p>Because the writer's process of thought is so important to the English essay, your professors will tell you that good reading is the beginning of good writing and that the process of good reading is itself good thinking: how you read will be reflected in how you write<mdash/>meaning that to be able to write well you yourself must think critically, take notes, and make observations while you read instead of merely absorbing the words on the page.</p>
            <p>One aspect of English essays that can be a stumbling block to students is also the thing that can make it so rewarding: Far from having a single correct answer, texts have a multitude of possible solutions and interpretations. Because there is no absolute, definitive interpretation, many students can be caught in the difference between opinions and arguments: sometimes it can feel unnerving to make an interpretive leap because you think that it isn't 100<percent/> certain<mdash/>but that's actually the nature of the claims we make as English writers: while they are substantiated, they are fundamentally arguable. An arguable claim is different from an opinion in that arguments are substantiated by textual evidence while opinions are not.</p>

            <title>Evidence</title>
            <p><q><em>Evidence is two parts: textual evidence (quotes and paraphrases) and analysis.</em></q></p>
            <p>Evidence in English is almost exclusively textual; however, textual evidence is not <q>evidence</q> in itself! When you include textual evidence it should be because its specific language or mechanical aspects are <q>meaningful in a way that is irreducible</q>; that is, it would be impossible to rephrase the language in any other way without losing some important part of the meaning. However the meaning that <em>you</em> see in the textual evidence is not self-evident: when you include textual evidence you must always use your own words to explain how it is meaningful to your argument.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><p>When you get an essay back, carefully consider the comments your professor has made. Professors put a lot of time and thought into writing them. These comments are a great way not only to improve your writing but also serve as the beginning of a conversation you can have with your professor during office hours.</p></li>
                <li><p>Although English writing has a reputation for being florid and ornate, as in every other discipline, good writing is clear writing. Don't use as many adverbs as possible or sacrifice clarity and coherence for an elevated register.</p></li>
                <li><p>Make sure you're telling your reader exactly what you want them to think. Don't make your reader intuit your argument.</p></li>
                <li><p>If you don't know something, look it up! Answering your own questions is part of the writing process. You have the vast power of the Internet at your fingertips! If you're having trouble doing this on your own, schedule a writing appointment or get in touch with a librarian!</p></li>
                <li><p>You can get better with each assignment, but you're not going to become a top-tier English scholar in one assignment, or even one semester. Don't get discouraged! Focus on getting better.</p></li>
                <li><p>A thesis can be more than one sentence! And it doesn't have to be at the end of the first paragraph.</p></li>
                <li><p>You can use the first person, but use it carefully. Use <em>I</em> when you need to acknowledge that your view diverges from others' views or when you need to be clear about some aspect of your methods which you personally did (<em>One</em> did not review a year's worth of newspapers; <em>I</em> did).</p></li>
                <li><p>Don't hide behind an <em>I</em> to say that it's just little old me who thinks something, but that it's probably not right; however, some hedging is good! You don't have to <q>prove</q> something beyond a shadow of a doubt; you can be circumspect and use words like <q>suggests</q> or <q>indicates</q> to acknowledge where the evidence isn't strong enough to make a bolder claim.</p></li>
                <li><p>Introduce the authors of your secondary sources in text. This helps establish context and shows that you are entering into a conversation with other scholars.</p></li>

        <title>Writing for History</title>
        <p>Among scholars, historians are unique in their pursuit of knowledge from pasts that only get further away rather than clearer as time goes on. The difficulty of sometimes vast amounts of elapsed time combined with the intense and often bewildering particularity of different historical moments can make writing academically about history challenging for students. Read this guide to get an idea of how to think about your task as a historian in training!</p>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Genres</title>
            <p>Of the several kinds of writing you will be asked to do in your history classes, close readings of a primary source are perhaps the most foundational. A close reading is a paper in which you develop an analytical argument that takes into account the historical context the source is from. The skills you use to write a primary source close reading are transferable to the secondary source critiques that you will be asked to write. Another way to think of these critiques is as a way to <q>test other scholars.</q> Other history papers include papers that put primary and secondary sources in conversation with one another, annotated bibliographies, research prospectuses and comparisons of a historian's versus a popular source's version of an event to elucidate the difference between how historians and how others think about the past.</p>

            <p><q><em><brackets>The purpose</brackets> is two-fold: firstly writing is a creative process, so we figure things out as we write, <ellipsis/> but the end goal is to understand the people of the past and why they did things the way they did.</em></q></p>
            <p>Unlike writing in many other academic disciplines, most good historical writing is open and accessible to the general reader. Part of the purpose of historical writing, then, is to bring the stories and patterns of the past to the attention of modern readers. Within these stories and patterns are the figures of the past. These figures can sometimes seem very strange, they can seem evil, they can seem funny, but they are ultimately human beings, and your task as a historian is to make sense of them from their perspectives to the extent to which that's possible<mdash/>and it's a task that is, in fact, impossible. And that's part of what you can love about it: Your job is to try to make sense of a puzzle, always knowing that you can't quite get there.</p>

            <title>Valued Characteristics</title>
            <p><q><em>Imagination is really important. <q>Analytical</q> for us isn't like looking through a microscope, but having to really imagine, and being willing to think about things in new ways.</em></q></p>
            <p>Writing for history can be very difficult because you are, in essence, being asked to disregard what you know<mdash/>what your present has taught you<mdash/>and recreate a world that you have never seen and that has ceased existing. For this reason, historical writing is an act of inquiry that is both logical and imaginative. To be a good historian you must begin by making observations and then use these observations to ask good questions that will help you reimagine the past in a new way or to find the gaps in existing ways of understanding it. These questions and new ways of seeing will allow you to gain a deeper knowledge of the past and, hopefully, a deeper empathy for its figures.</p>
            <p>A second important part of writing historically is understanding that making a historical argument does not mean disregarding your sources to write what you want; rather, it means to allow your observations to help you make a convincing argument by presenting them in the truest possible way: historians feel they have an ethical responsibility to not abuse their evidence, to not do violence to the sources of the past, to not force a source to say something that it did not intend to say. For this reason, when you make an interpretive leap you must justify it so that you do not misrepresent a source.</p>
            <p>This second characteristic of historical writing is often called being <q>value neutral.</q> However, being value neutral doesn't mean that historians don't see things as right and wrong<mdash/>instead it means that in order to actually be able to distinguish one from the other a historian must first begin by understanding the people of the past<mdash/>and you can't do that unless you have put aside your own moral lens long enough to figure them out. Putting aside your lenses is, indeed, the thing that will allow you to ask the questions you will need to ask in order to imagine the past<mdash/>questions that are not merely factual, that are not anachronistic or judgmental, but analytical.</p>

Other music-writing genres<mdash/>which do not require heavy amounts of technical vocabulary<mdash/>will be assigned to both majors and non-majors. These less technical papers include a version of the analytical paper, where you write a listening guide for a piece of music; book reviews, patterned after professional book reviews, where you review books dealing with musical issues; field work papers, where you analyze the interaction between music and culture on or off campus; reception histories, where you describe the reception of a particular composer when they were alive, and analyze why and how that reception changed over time; broader versions of reception histories, where you take a work where there is a critical mass of scholarship and then combine analysis, history, and criticism of that work; performance reports, informal pieces of writing where you describe what you heard at a performance, what the event was like, and how the audience responded; as well as conventional research papers.</p>

            <p>Like most endeavors, writing academically about music has many entwined purposes. First of all, writing about music will help you learn about music. This will mean going beyond your subjective reaction to a score and exploring the details of its artistry. Further, by learning to write well about music, you will also foster writing skills that you will be able to apply to other kinds of writing that you will do in future. Still more, by writing papers about music, you will be joining a scholarly conversation, whose complex and multifarious voices will push you to evaluate complex arguments and learning how to persuade others yourself.</p>

            <p><q><em>How the heck do you write about sound?</em></q></p>
            <p>One of the greatest stumbling blocks for new music writers can sometimes be the thing that drew you to music in the first place; we have all heard music, and we love it and know how important it is. But being able to transform that love into a profound and specific analysis of the <q>hows</q> and <q>whys</q> of a chosen piece of music is an exercise in patience and practice. But hang in there! That exercise will lead you to a deeper appreciation for music than you began with.</p>
            <p>When you are writing about texts, you are using words to analyze words. However, when writing about musical texts, the thing you are analyzing is sound, which is invisible. So in order to write well about music you will need to meaningfully translate what you hear into writing.</p>
            <p>When you are trying to do the work of such meaningful translation, when you are listening to and looking at a score, there will always be an infinite number of ways of looking at it, some of which are more persuasive and reasonable than others. In order to write persuasively, and choose which way to <q>look</q> at a score or even a book, the most important thing to keep in mind is to go beyond description. While description is a great starting point<mdash/>because good description ensures that you are paying attention and noticing what is unusual<mdash/>analysis requires explaining why that something is unusual or significant.</p>

            <p>In your music classes, just like your English and history classes, evidence is almost exclusively textual. However in music-writing, scores and performances are also considered to be texts, and accurate descriptions of them are what constitute evidence. Unlike in the sciences, you won't be creating evidence yourself (by doing an experiment), instead you are finding evidence in secondary sources and by your own observation.</p>

                <li><p>Describing music involves using a series of agreed-upon metaphors (e.g. a wet sound v. a dry sound). While such terminology can be daunting, it can be very helpful when writing about sound.</p></li>
                <li><p>With the above tip in mind, there is sometimes a misconception that when you are writing about music it has to be really jargon-laden and technical. If you are uncomfortable with writing about music, it is always better to say what you have to say clearly rather than throwing words out like a cloud of squid ink.</p></li>
                <li><p>Because music takes place in time, there is a tendency to work your way through a piece that you are writing about from beginning to end.

        <title>Writing for Psychology</title>
        <p>Psychology presents unique challenges to student writers: It can be difficult to navigate between quantitative scientific data and the ineluctably qualitative arguments that you'll need to make about human behavior. Read this guide to get a better idea of what it's important to focus on while writing for psychology!</p>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Genres</title>
            <p>There are two main kinds of writing in psychology. The first is research reports, in which you will convey to your audience the research you have done, the reason you did it, what method you did it by, and the results and conclusions you arrived at. The second type of writing you will do is literature reviews, in which you will write papers focused on canvassing a particular area of research to generate new conclusions about that area. Another type of writing you may be asked to do that is less common is translational writing, in which you will be asked to <q>translate</q> scientific writing for general audiences.</p>

            <p>The purpose of writing in psychology is, at its most fundamental level, to communicate our understanding of behavior and mental processes. Because knowledge in psychology can make a good and meaningful difference in the lives of people, it is paramount that your writing is understandable. In order to promote meaningful change in people's lives, you must first be able to communicate the findings of empirical research effectively to both other scientists and larger audiences.</p>

            <p><q><em>The goal is to be honest.</em></q></p>
            <p>Because psychology is a science and psychological writing is used to change how individuals and societies think about and treat others, it is crucial that arguments are made honestly and using empirical data. In your essays, it's therefore important that you prioritize presenting your data fairly over pushing your own interpretation of the data. Instead, while you make your argument you should allow room for alternate explanations: be honest about what you know and what you don't know and recognize the limitations of your argument.</p>
            <p>In your attempt to be as honest as possible with your findings, you will be aided by being precise and concise rather than ambiguous and flowery. It is difficult to be straightforward if your writing is confusing or vague about what your results actually are and how you obtained them.</p>
            <p>While presenting the facts of your research clearly and plainly is vital, it is equally important to <q>go beyond the data</q> by writing about its applied relevance in interdisciplinary and ethical spaces.</p>

            <p><q><em>In psychology, you can almost never see the thing you want to know<nbsp/><ellipsis/><nbsp/></em></q></p>
            <p>The data you use should be empirical rather than textual. For this reason, a theory from a secondary source is not evidence, and most professors discourage the use of quotes. However, while psychological data is scientific, <em>how</em> you interpret it is inherently qualitative. While in the natural sciences, for example, if you want to know the temperature at which a metal melts, you can take a thermometer and watch and see when it melts and you'll know the answer: you can observe the physical process you want to know about directly. In psychology you can almost never see the psychological process you want to know about because it's inside a person. For example, you could have an idea that a pharmaceutical increases hunger and then, when you give this pharmaceutical to people they eat more. Did the pharmaceutical increase hunger? Possibly. That's a good possible explanation for what happened, but you didn't see hunger, you just saw eating and you have to make a link between what you saw (which was people eating) and the underlying thing you think is in there (which is hunger). In this way, while the data you collect are wholly scientific, the way you choose to explain that evidence is, by nature, conjectural.</p>
