    <title>Writing With Awareness</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>Puget Sound's Threshold 2020 Diversity Strategic Plan states:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>We at Puget Sound intentionally conceptualize and view diversity as a matter of equity and inclusion. In doing so, we aim to understand and actively respond to the ways organizational aspects of our society and of our own university often work against those principles, excluding some groups and individuals from our community while including others. The work of diversity, accordingly, seeks to account for and redress deeply embedded historical practices and legacies, forms of cultural and social representation, and institutional policies and processes that can systematically exclude groups or individuals from full participation in higher education and the considerable benefits it offers.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Language use is part of this work of diversity; as writers, we are also part of that work. While the impacts of language on individual feelings and circumstances may, on the surface, seem insignificant (<q>sticks and stones,</q> as the adage goes), language can embody prejudice, discrimination, and status hierarchies. Words, like people and societies, have histories. Some words, such as racial slurs, are overtly bigoted, while others more subtly express longstanding stereotypes or attitudes about particular groups of people. For instance, patronizing and parochial treatment of specific languages or linguistic types derives from discrimination and intolerance of groups who speak those languages.</p>
        <p>By acknowledging the role language plays in reinforcing inequalities, we recognize the privileges and disadvantages of different groups of people. Additionally, using words rooted in hate and oppression perpetuates hate and oppression and denies groups of people opportunities to reclaim their individual and collective agency. However, if we are unfamiliar with such histories, it can sometimes be difficult to identify terminologies of oppression.</p>
        <p>This chapter aims to offer different ways for us, as scholars and citizens of the world, to be intentional about the language we use. We have attempted to clarify terms and provide more inclusive, equality-based alternatives, and we hope that these will help us all as writers to be aware of and attentive to the diversity of experiences that our audiences will have.</p>
        <p>Because terms and preferences vary and change, we have compiled only general guidelines, and our suggestions should be considered in the contexts of their usages. Please also note that each section deals with a complex subject, and there are excellent resources here on campus for learning more. We make suggestions in each section below about departments and programs that offer relevant courses, but our suggestions are not comprehensive. Looking for courses that fulfill the <url href="https://www.pugetsound.edu/academics/curriculum-courses/knowledge-identity-and-power">Knowledge, Identity, and Power</url> (<acro>KNOW</acro>) graduation requirement is another good way to find relevant courses. Get involved in the <url href="https://www.pugetsound.edu/academics/academic-resources/race-pedagogy-institute">Race and Pedagogy Institute</url> (<init>RPI</init>) or in programs offered through the <url href="https://www.pugetsound.edu/student-life/cice/">Center for Intercultural and Civic Engagement</url> (<init>CICE</init>).</p>
        <p>We've tried to be as nuanced as possible in a short space, but, there are surely things we have missed and things we still need to learn. However, just as language can change, so, too, can this handbook. If you would like to suggest any improvements to the guidelines that follow, please email us at <url href="mailto:soundwriting@pugetsound.edu"><c>soundwriting@pugetsound.edu</c></url>.</p>

            <p>When people consider their culture, race, or nationality superior to other cultures, races, or nationalities, or when they view and evaluate other cultures through the lens of their own culture, we say that they are being ethnocentric. Ethnocentrism can be difficult to avoid because we are all informed by our experiences, and it is not always easy to recognize how our cultural lenses affects our world-views. While we may perceive our ways of living as the best and most valid, global awareness encourages us to remember that there are other, equally valid lifestyles and experiences. In order to write with global awareness, then, we should avoid writing ethnocentrically.</p>
            <p>
                Here are some questions to ask yourself as you write:
                <ul>
                    <li>Am I making broad generalizations, or do I write with complexity and nuance about people who are different than me? Am I considering other perspectives respectfully rather than in a patronizing or paternalistic way?</li>
                    <li>Am I making value judgments about other ways of living? If so, are they appropriate to the specific discipline or course for which I'm writing?</li>
                    <li>Do I use thorough and fair scholarly sources?</li>
                    <li>Are all of my claims supported with evidence?</li>
                    <li>Do my warrants (the logic connecting my evidence to my claims) rely on Western/American definitions or world-views (for example, evidence: a certain group of people still uses hunting and gathering as its primary mode of subsistence; claim: people in this group are uncivilized; warrant: <q>civilization</q> is defined by advanced agriculture)?</li>
                    <li>Am I aware of my own cultural biases and mindful about how they might affect my scholarship and language choices?</li>

        <title>Writing with Respect</title>
        <p>Writing with respect is a crucial component of writing with awareness. By demonstrating to your readers that you strive to be aware and respectful of their various identities and experiences, you make your writing more inclusive and inviting<mdash/>and make it more likely that your audience will engage with your ideas.</p>
        <p>
            Here are some tips for avoiding disrespectful language in your writing:
            <dl>
                <li>
                    <title>Write with specificity.</title>
                    <p>Don't make generalizations about groups of people. No individual represents an entire group, and individuals cannot be wholly defined by the groups they are in.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <title>Write with attention and the desire to keep learning.</title>
                    <p>Don't intentionally write harmful, bigoted, or ignorant statements about people or groups of people. If you're unsure of whether or not what you're writing is harmful, do some research or ask people who have a greater knowledge of the group in question, preferably someone within that group.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <title>Write with equity.</title>
                    <p>Don't make marginalization central to your discussion of marginalized individuals or groups, unless marginalization is the topic at hand. For instance, a woman of color can be a scientist<mdash/>just as someone with a less culturally marked identity can be. When you write about a woman of color who is a scientist, unless the focus of your writing is how her identity has impacted her professional life, concentrate on the science she does.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <title>Use inclusive, people-first language as much as possible.</title>
                    <p>Emphasize the person, rather than one aspect of the person's identity. We all could be described in many ways, and calling a person <q>a <fillin/>,</q> emphasizes the one trait, rather than that trait as one of many that could be used to describe that person. For instance, saying <q>She is an asthmatic</q> emphasizes her disability, while <q>She is a person who has asthma,</q> emphasizes that she is a person first<mdash/>a person who may also be a parent, a teacher, and a person with any number of other significant identities.</p>

        <title>Inclusive Language</title>
        <subsection>
            <title>Language towards gender inclusivity</title>
            <p>Sexism, which we define in <xref provisional="helpful-terms-for-gender-inclusivity"/>, refers to discrimination of individuals based on sex. As the definition notes, sexism has historically described discrimination specifically against women. The perceived social and biological inferiority of women has existed for centuries in the West (and also throughout the globe), and although women in the last century have made advances<mdash/>the right to own property and vote, for example<mdash/>sexism prevails, especially against women of color and trans women. Women still, on average, earn lower wages than men; women are much more likely than men to be raped or stalked; and women are still underrepresented in positions of power and leadership. Importantly, women of color, at the intersection of race and gender, face each of these challenges to a greater extent than White women. Examples of such intersectional injustices are how, on average, White and Asian American women make about 20% less than White men, while Black and Latina women make about 30 and 40% less than White men respectively or how female immigrants of color sometimes have to choose between reporting domestic abuse and facing deportation or detention. Part of writing with awareness and respect means that you as an author are attentive to the context of historical and current discrimination that women face and cognizant of how the choices you make in writing engage with that context.</p>
            <p>Writing with attention to gender inclusivity, however, can be onerous because sexism is ingrained in English. As we wrote at the beginning of this chapter, language can embody prejudice, discrimination, and hierarchies. We have historically used the pronoun <q>he</q> as the standard, universal pronoun. In English, we have only <q>Mr.</q> for men (a title that is the same, regardless of men's marital status), but <q>Miss</q> and <q>Mrs.</q> for women (titles that mark not only gender but also marital status as an essential component of a woman's identity). We also have policemen, firemen, fishermen,and many other job titles that are used generically for all employees in the profession, even though women also work in those professions; many of those titles have female equivalents (policewoman, firewoman, fisherwoman), but those titles are never used generically to refer to all people in the profession<mdash/>and gender is not necessarily important to the work involved in those job titles.</p>
            <p>But language changes! <q>He</q> is no longer generally accepted as a universal pronoun, and alternatives like singular <q>they</q> have grown in popularity and acceptance. <q>Ms.</q> was created as a parallel title to <q>Mr.,</q> as titles that do not mark marital status. Professional titles such as <q>flight attendant,</q> instead of <q>stewardess,</q> offer gender-neutral job titles that emphasize the work the person does, rather than the gender of the person doing the work. These changes come not from grammarians; they come from people like you who saw injustice and acted against it. Keep reading to learn more about what you can do to continue to combat sexism in your speaking and writing.</p>

                    <li>
                        <title>Mix up the order.</title>
                        <p>If you refer frequently to men and women, husbands and wives, sons and daughters, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, etc., mix up the order to avoid putting one gender continually ahead of the other. In fact, unless gender is a central facet of your discussion, it's better to avoid perpetuating gender binaries by using alternatives such as <q>distinguished guests,</q> <q>people,</q> <q>human beings,</q> <q>children,</q> <q>adults,</q> <q>individuals,</q> and <q>couples.</q></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <title>Refer to women in the same way you would men.</title>
                        <p>If you wouldn't say <q>Mr. Faulkner</q> when writing about Faulkner, then don't say <q>Ms. Austen</q> when writing about Jane Austen. Similarly, if a woman holds a title like <q>Dr.,</q> then refer to her as Dr. in the same way you would refer to a male M.D. or Ph.D.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <title>Avoid sexist descriptions and terminology.</title>
                        <p>Numerous English words are rooted in sexist ideas about how women should act and live. Terms like <q>barren,</q> <q>spinster,</q> <q>feisty,</q> <q>coy,</q> <q>shrill,</q> <q>emotional,</q> <q>hysterical,</q> <q>frumpy,</q> <q>exotic,</q> <q>ditzy,</q> and <q>catty</q> can all convey implicit judgments about women. Note: the word <q>exotic</q> in particular is an intersectionally oppressive word that has been historically applied to women of color. The word acts to reify Whiteness as the norm while in turn hypersexualizing women of color, and thus making them the targets of sexual violence.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <title>Be conscious of gender stereotypes.</title>
                        <p>Pay attention to where you're using certain pronouns. Saying, <q>The lawyer won his trial</q> and <q>The nurse couldn't find her scrubs</q> are also forms of sexist language because they perpetuate gender stereotypes (i.e., the assumption that lawyers are always men and nurses are always women).</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <title>Be conscious of heteronormativity.</title>
                        <p>Women don't always marry men. Women don't always marry. To this effect, phrases such as <q>She needs a man</q> or <q>She should get married</q> perpetuate heteronormative expectations.</p>

            <title>Language towards neuro- and physical inclusivity</title>
            <p>Ableism, or discrimination in favor of able-bodied people, is a broad category of discriminatory beliefs and actions that, like many other kinds of discrimination makes itself known in both overt forms (such as the eugenics movement) and covert forms (such as buildings that lack wheelchair access and/or Braille translations). Unfortunately, both such kinds of discrimination can seep into the language we use on an everyday basis; we, as writers, aren't always aware of the invidious history of words that we use. For instance, while in the early twentieth century people classified as <q>idiots</q> were subject to forced sterilization, we now use the word casually.</p>
            <p>While it is impossible to foresee and prevent every knowledge gap, using people-first language is a way to combat ableism by acknowledging the common humanity of all individuals rather than referring to certain individuals only by their disability or handicap. What follows is a list of words to avoid as well as words that we hope you use to write and think more inclusively. Please consider these terms as an introduction into an ongoing conversation rather than a comprehensive guide, and continue to foster your awareness by continuing to learn and ask questions!</p>

                        <p>Just as with women and people from marginalized backgrounds, only refer to disabilities if they are relevant to what you're writing. For example, referencing a wheelchair in a sentence like <q>A man in a wheelchair let me borrow his pen</q> is unnecessary and ableist.

            <title>Language Towards Racial and Ethnic Inclusivity</title>
            <p>There is no absolute consensus regarding the correct terms to describe races, but there remain some obviously racist terms that do not warrant use in formal writing. Language changes, and we all need to be informed of current usages. For instance, in contemporary America, using the word <q>Black</q> as an adjective (as with <q>Black people</q>) is widely accepted as inoffensive. In contrast, the term <q>colored</q> was once widely used, but it is now generally considered inappropriate.</p>
            <p>Some racist histories are embedded in language in less familiar ways.  For example, many people avoid the term <q>caucasian</q> because of its origins in pseudo-scientific theories about the superiority of white-skinned peoples in certain parts of Europe. And, although white-skinned people might feel uncomfortable with a racial descriptor such as White, there is ethnocentric bias in assuming whiteness as a standard and using terms like Black, Asian, and Latino to designate people as different from that standard.</p>
            <p>Additionally, writing about race and ethnicity is complex because identities are complex, and because they are linked to past and present histories of oppression and intergroup conflict. It is helpful to keep in mind similarities and distinctions between the concepts of race and ethnicity.</p>
            <paragraphs>
                <title>Race</title>
                <p>is a socially constructed system of categories and affiliations based primarily on physical characteristics such as variations in hair, eyes, or skin color. Across most parts of the modern world, the construction of race is linked to inequalities in power and histories of oppression including discrimination and slavery.</p>
            </paragraphs>
            <paragraphs>
                <title>Ethnicity</title>
                <p>generally refers to identities or affiliations based on cultural factors such as nationality, regional heritage, religion, and/or language.</p>
            </paragraphs>
            <p>Both ethnicity and race can make people targets of stereotyping, prejudice, and violence. Both types of identities can also provide a sense of belonging or pride for people. Because identities are socially constructed, the categories of race and ethnicity can differ across places and time. For example, being Jewish was once considered a racial category. The racial category of Asian may or may not include peoples from India or the Pacific Islands. In the U.S., ethnicity (vastly simplified as Hispanic or non-Hispanic) is typically tracked separately from race. When writing about identities that may be linked to either race or ethnicity, it is common to mention both (i.e., race/ethnicity).</p>
            <p>Another complexity is that people often identify with more than one group or category, and so writers may use terms like multi-racial or multi-ethnic. One problem with these terms is that they render invisible specific racial and cultural identities, such as being Black and Asian; White and Puerto Rican; or Native American, Black, and Latina. As a writer, you should think critically about the assumptions and invisibilities reflected in choices you make when writing about race and ethnicity.</p>
            <p>It is helpful to be aware of conventions within particular disciplines, but also to remember that these conventions may reflect racism embedded in histories of the academy, and that scholars within and across different academic disciplines may not agree on definitions and conventions related to race and ethnicity. When in doubt, do some research and do not be afraid to engage in conversations about appropriate usage. When referring to a particular person or group, use the term that they prefer.</p>
            <p>
                Here are some additional trends to be aware of as you attempt to write towards anti-racism.
                <ul>
                    <li>There remains no consensus about  the proper capitalization of <q>Black,</q> especially in relation to <q>White.</q> You can ask your professors for their preferences and, as always, research the implications of each usage. It is always best to be intentional, consistent, and open-minded.</li>
                    <li>The distinction between Native American and American Indian is also contested. American Indian includes indigenous peoples from the continental U.S., while Native American encompasses indigenous peoples from Alaska and Hawaii. As always, if a preference is expressed, respect it. If not, do some research and select a term advisedly.</li>
                    <li>Latino/a (in other stylizations, Latin@, Latinx, which have slightly different meanings) refers to any person of Latin American descent living in America. Mexican-Americans may also identify as Chicano/a (or Xicano/a). The terms Chicano/a come from the 1960's Mexican American Civil Rights Movement and represent a more political stance on identity than Latnix (as they are example of words that were reappropriated by the people who they originally referred to in a derogatory way). Hispanic describes any person of Spanish-speaking heritage and may be offensive to people who identify as Latinx or Chicano/a because the word reinforces the history of Spanish colonialism. The meanings of these terms are debated and, as a result, not fixed.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>A special note on the term <q>minority,</q> courtesy of the Nesbitt-Johnson Writing Center at Hamilton College: <q>Avoid the term minority if possible. Minority is often used to describe groups of people who are not part of the majority. This term is being phased out because it may imply inferiority and because minorities often are not in the numerical minority. An alternative might be historically marginalized populations. If avoiding the term is not possible, qualify the term with the appropriate specific descriptor: religious minority <em>NOT</em> minority.</q></p>

            <title>Language towards <init>LGBTQ+</init> inclusivity</title>
            <p><init>LGBTQ+</init> spans a wide and complicated range of sexual orientations, gender identities, and diverse bodies. The acronym itself stands for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, Queer/Questioning and others. Even this list does not cover the full range of identities represented by the acronym<mdash/> indeed, some advocate for an extended <init>LGBTQQIAP2S</init>, which stands for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, Queer, Questioning, Intersex, Asexual, Pansexual, and Two-Spirit. Other terms for the community of people who do not identify within the dominant forms of sexuality and gender (heterosexuality or cisgenderism) include <init>GSM</init> (Gender and Sexuality Minorities) or <init>GSD</init> (Gender and Sexuality Diverse). These last two terms, in particular, indicate that members of this community do not all identify as one particular identity at all times; many individuals within the community choose not to identify or to identify as fluid. The amorphous nature of the name portends the difficulty writers may have when referring to individuals within the community: the language of the <init>LGBTQ+</init> community is ever-evolving, so it may not always be clear to you which term to use. To be as respectful and inclusive as possible, use people-first language (say <q>a person who is Queer</q> rather than <q>a Queer person</q>), and keep learning and asking questions. What follows is a list of basic terms and definitions that describe diverse genders and sexualities.</p>

                        <p>is an adjective and umbrella term that describes individuals whose gender identity is different from the sex they were assigned at birth. Many people take hormones and some undergo surgery, but neither of these medical treatments is requisite for a transgender identity.</p>
                        <p>It is inappropriate to use transgender as a noun (e.g., a transgender) or to use the term transgendered.</p>

                    <li>
                        <title>Transsexual</title>
                        <p>is an older term that is not an umbrella term and is preferred mostly by individuals who have changed (or seek to change) their bodies through medical procedures. It is best not to use this term unless someone has indicated it as their preference.</p>

                        <title>Trans or trans*</title>
                        <p>are shortened versions of <q>transgender</q> and the spectrum of identities that accompany that term. The asterisk in trans* represents the multitude of identities that <q>trans</q> encompasses. Be careful when using this term around audiences that may not understand exactly what it means.</p>

                        <p>are ways some transgender individuals choose to identify themselves. <init>MTF</init> stands for male-to-female, and <init>FTM</init> stands for female-to-male. Only use these terms if the individual has indicated their preference for them, as some people choose to identify as man or woman without any modifier.</p>

                        <p>refers to the period of time in someone's life during which they make an inward and outward transition to the gender with which they identify. This period and what occurs within it differ from person to person. <alert>DO NOT</alert> use the term <q>sex change,</q> as it obscures the difference between sex and gender and does not represent all transition experiences.</p>

            <title>Pronouns</title>
            <p>A pronoun (see <xref ref="pronouns"/>) is a word (including I, you, me, he, she, and they) that refers to a noun, when it's unwieldy to keep referring to that noun by name. When pronouns refer to and represent people, pronouns are usually connected to gender identity, which is the internal, personal perception that one has about one's own gender. A person may identify on either end of the gender binary (man/woman or boy/girl), or in between or outside of it. Using appropriate pronouns is as important as referring to a person by the correct name.</p>
            <paragraphs xml:id="singular-they">
                <title>They As a Singular Pronoun.</title>
                <p>Using appropriate pronouns, though, is complicated because gender-neutral singular pronouns are being debated actively at the moment, and, as we discuss above, many people are now arguing that gender is not even relevant in many of the circumstances in which we once emphasized it (for instance, how often is it really important to know whether the person in a sales position is a <q>saleswoman</q> or a <q>salesman</q>?). Debate over gender and pronouns is not new; people have been proposing gender-neutral pronouns <url href="http://www.english.illinois.edu/-people-/faculty/debaron/essays/epicene.htm">since at least the mid-nineteenth century</url>. However, the need for adequate pronouns in English has become more pressing as trans people have become more visible and as the idea of gender identity has been discussed more openly.</p>
            </paragraphs>
            <p>People who identify as female typically use she/her pronouns, and those who identify as male usually use he/him pronouns. Individuals whose gender identity does not fit the binary sometimes use they/them pronouns, and<mdash/>more generally<mdash/><q>they</q> is becoming increasingly accepted as a gender-neutral, third-person singular pronoun. In this book, we use <q>they</q> as a gender-neutral pronoun in circumstances when the gender of a person is unknown (for example, <q>Please ask each of the students what they would like for dessert</q>) or when that person identifies as neither male nor female (for example, <q>Do you know my friend Ari? They are a math major</q>).</p>
            <p>Pronouns are important representations of people's gender identity. If you don't know what pronouns someone uses, simply ask them, <q>What pronouns do you use?</q> If you accidentally use the wrong pronoun, apologize, correct yourself, and remember for next time.</p>

            <title>Language Toward Socioeconomic Inclusivity</title>
            <p>Unless you're a sociologist or economist, writing about social class can be difficult because information about non-technical, correct, and respectful language can be hard to come by. While the last few years have given rise to more conversations around race, gender, and sexuality, discussions of socioeconomic differences have been comparatively lacking. Socioeconomic status is an important topic in many social sciences and relates to a variety of identities people may hold such as being a first-generation college student, being homeless, or being rich or poor.</p>
            <p>Although American individualism and Protestant ethic suggest that both affluence and poverty are the responsibility of the individual, the reality is that socioeconomic status is largely structural and linked to opportunities in education, employment, home ownership, and so on. As such, it is important to note that inequities in socioeconomic status are often intertwined with identities like race, gender, and sexuality. Disparities in education and employment, moreover, produce and reproduce structures of poverty and affluence.</p>
            <p>Here's an oversimplified example to show you what we're talking about:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>College-educated parents are likely to be able to afford to live in a neighborhood with an adequately funded, high-functioning school<mdash/>or to be able to send their children to an adequately funded, high-functioning school. Their children are likely to learn and internalize language and mannerisms at home that are consistent with the language and mannerisms at school, and thus are more likely to succeed<mdash/>and, if they don't succeed initially, their parents are likely in a good position to advocate for them or to help them strategize ways to succeed.</p>
                <p>Alternatively, parents who are not college-educated are less likely to be able to send their children to an adequately funded, high-functioning school. Their children are less likely to go to school already knowing the language and mannerisms that are expected in school, and so those children must work harder in school to learn the things that schools expect. The farther along the children go in school, the more important it is that their hard work pays off, and if they don't succeed initially, their parents are likely not to know from experience how to advocate for them or to help them strategize ways to succeed.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>While vastly unnuanced, this example demonstrates how social class embodies generations of oppression and oppressing. Statistically, people in the United States tend to end up in socioeconomic positions similar to those of their parents, so both affluence and poverty tend to be cyclical. Writing about socioeconomic status or class without acknowledging inequalities in opportunities does injustice to the people that those inequalities affect. Avoiding classist language is an important step toward changing the classist ideologies that underlie and reproduce the structural inequalities that lead to economic disparity.</p>
            <p>
                Although there aren't clear guidelines to follow, we next give you a few helpful definitions and terms to avoid to get you started writing more inclusively.

                        <title>Avoid</title>
                        <p>classist terms such as: ghetto, white-trash, classy, thug, inner-city, and terms like <q>high class</q> and <q>low class</q> because they convey biased judgments about people within certain socioeconomic settings.</p>

        <title>Writing and Correctness</title>
        <p>Languages are constantly evolving to suit the distinct locations, speakers or circumstances in which they are spoken and written. Despite the dynamic nature of language, countries<mdash/>including the United States<mdash/>often develop <q>standard</q> forms of their languages that are taught in schools and used for professional and legal communication and that are often treated as <q>natural</q> or <q>correct.</q></p>
        <paragraphs xml:id="SAE">
            <title>Standard American English</title>
            <p>In the United States, our <q>standard</q> language is called Standard American English (<init>SAE</init>) or Mainstream American English (<init>MAE</init>). <init>SAE</init> exists primarily as a written form of English and includes the set of historically and culturally venerated rules that regulate English grammar, syntax, pronunciation, and spelling. Of course, the notion that <init>SAE</init> is <q>standard</q> is contested: On the one hand, because language changes constantly, there is no one moment in time when all users of <init>SAE</init> can agree completely on what the standard is; on the other, <init>SAE</init> is not truly <q>American</q> in that it is not the language of all Americans and has often been used to normalize white, middle- and upper-class language systems and to denigrate language systems that differ from them (and that hence, become <q>non-standard</q> and <q>improper</q>). In this sense, <init>SAE</init> has been placed at the top of a linguistic hierarchy, leaving other kinds of English open to stigmatization.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <p>In addition to Standard American English, other varieties of American English include African-American English (<init>AAE</init>) (also called African-American Language, or <init>AAL</init>), Chicano English (also called Mexican American English), Cajun English, Hawaiian Pidgin (also called Hawaiian Pidgin English and Hawaiian Creole English), and Southern White American English. These varieties of English not only have some different vocabulary than <init>SAE</init> but also<mdash/>and more importantly<mdash/>have some different grammatical rules than <init>SAE</init>. American Sign Language (<init>ASL</init>), too, has a different grammatical structure than written <init>SAE</init>.</p>
        <p>While there are many varieties of English in the United States, <init>SAE</init> and its speakers are treated with special privilege. Fluency in spoken <init>SAE</init> does not necessarily mean facility in writing the standardized norms of <init>SAE</init>; however, individuals who are raised speaking <init>SAE</init> come to college with an advantage over those who do not (or who speak it as a second dialect). <init>SAE</init> grammar may come more easily to speakers of <init>SAE</init> than to speakers of nonstandard varieties of English (think of how hard it is to learn a different word order in a foreign language).</p>
        <p>Different varieties of English may also be associated with different rhetorical conventions. For instance, in college we are often encouraged to use the <q>topic-centered</q> discourse associated with <init>SAE</init>, in which one point logically and explicitly leads to a single following point. However, different discourse styles are associated with other varieties of English. For example, <init>AAE</init> is characterized by a <q>topic-associating</q> discourse in which various related topics are combined to make an implicit point. Readers who are used to <q>topic-centered</q> discourse may see <q>topic-associating</q> discourse styles as haphazard or unorganized because these readers fail to grasp the implicit meaning conveyed by the associated topics.</p>
        <p>There are many correct and valid ways to write, tell stories, and make arguments in English, and being versatile and able to communicate effectively in multiple contexts is an asset. While this handbook focuses on the conventions of written <init>SAE</init>, that does not mean that other language conventions are incorrect. Writing with awareness means being aware of the limitations of any one set of written conventions and respecting the validity of other conventions.</p>
